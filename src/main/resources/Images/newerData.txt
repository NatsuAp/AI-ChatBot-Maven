Question: 1 ### 1.  Which of the following pairs of declarations will cause an error message?  I. plaintext
double x = 14.7;
int y = x;  II. double x = 14.7;
int y = (int) x;  III. plaintext
int x = 14;
double y = x; ### A. None  B. I only  C. II only  D. III only  E. I and III only ### Correct Answer:  B ### Explanation: ### When  x  is converted to an integer, as in segment I, information is lost. Java requires that an explicit cast to an  int  be made, as in segment II. Note that segment II will cause  x  to be truncated: The value stored in  y  is  14 . By requiring the explicit cast, Java doesnât let you do this accidentally. In segment III,  y  will contain the value  14.0 . No explicit cast to a  double  is required since no information is lost. ###
