Question: 1
1.  Which of the following pairs of declarations will cause an error message?  I. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0082-01.jpg"/>  II. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0082-02.jpg"/>  III. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0082-03.jpg"/>
A. None  B. I only  C. II only  D. III only  E. I and III only
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
When  x  is converted to an integer, as in segment I, information is lost. Java requires that an explicit cast to an  int  be made, as in segment II. Note that segment II will cause  x  to be truncated: The value stored in  y  is  14 . By requiring the explicit cast, Java doesnât let you do this accidentally. In segment III,  y  will contain the value  14.0 . No explicit cast to a  double  is required since no information is lost.

Question: 2
2.  What output will be produced by the following?   System.out.print("\\* This is not\n a comment *\\");
A.  * This is not a comment *   B.  \* This is not a comment *\   C. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0082-04.jpg"/>  D. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0082-05.jpg"/>  E. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0082-06.jpg"/>
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
The string argument contains two escape sequences: â \\ â, which means print a backslash ( \ ), and â \n â, which means go to a new line. Choice E is the only choice that does both of these.

Question: 3
3.  Consider the following code segment.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0082-07.jpg"/>  If  n  is of type  int  and has a value of  0  when the segment is executed, what will happen?
A. An  ArithmeticException  will be thrown.  B. A syntax error will occur.  C. <i> statement1 </i>, but not <i> statement2 </i>, will be executed.  D. <i> statement2 </i>, but not <i> statement1 </i>, will be executed.  E. Neither <i> statement1 </i> nor <i> statement2 </i> will be executed; control will pass to the first statement following the  if  statement.
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
Short-circuit evaluation of the boolean expression will occur. The expression  (n != 0)  will evaluate to  false , which makes the entire boolean expression  false . Therefore the expression  (x / n &gt; 100)  will not be evaluated. Hence no division by zero will occur, which would have caused an  ArithmeticException  to be thrown. When the boolean expression has a value of  false , only the  else  part of the statement, <i> statement2 </i>, will be executed.

Question: 4
4.  Refer to the following code fragment.   double answer = 13 / 5;    System.out.println("13 / 5 = " + answer);   The output is   13 / 5 = 2.0   The programmer intends the output to be   13 / 5 = 2.6   Which of the following replacements for the first line of code will not fix the problem?
A.  double answer = (double) 13 / 5;   B.  double answer = 13 / (double) 5;   C.  double answer = 13.0 / 5;   D.  double answer = 13 / 5.0;   E.  double answer = (double) (13 / 5);
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
For this choice, the integer division  13/5  will be evaluated to  2 , which will then be cast to  2.0 . The output will be  13/5 = 2.0 . The compiler needs a way to recognize that real-valued division is required. All the other options provide a way.

Question: 5
5.  What value is stored in  result  if   int result = 13 - 3 * 6 / 4 % 3;
A. -5  B. 0  C. 13  D. -1  E. 12
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
The operators  *, / , and  %  have equal precedence, all higher than  - , and must be performed first, from left to right.  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0094-01.jpg"/>
#########################################################
Question: 6
6.  Suppose that addition and subtraction had higher precedence than multiplication and division. Then the expression   2 + 3 * 12 / 7 - 4 + 8   would evaluate to which of the following?
A. 11  B. 12  C. 5  D. 9  E. -4
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
The expression must be evaluated as if parenthesized like this:   (2 + 3) * 12 / (7 - 4 + 8)   This becomes  5 * 12 / 11 = 60 / 11 = 5 .
#########################################################
Question: 7
7.  Which is true of the following boolean expression, given that  x  is a variable of type  double ?   3.0 == x * (3.0 / x)
A. It will always evaluate to false.  B. It may evaluate to false for some values of  x .  C. It will evaluate to false only when  x  is zero.  D. It will evaluate to false only when  x  is very large or very close to zero.  E. It will always evaluate to true.
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Although the expression is always algebraically true for nonzero  x , the expression may evaluate to false. This could occur because of round-off error in performing the division and multiplication operations. Whether the right-hand side of the expression evaluates to exactly 3.0 depends on the value of  x . Note that if  x  is zero, the expression will be evaluated to  false  because the right-hand side will be assigned a value of  Infinity .
#########################################################
Question: 8
8.  Let  x  be a variable of type  double  that is positive. A program contains the boolean expression  (Math.pow(x,0.5) == Math.sqrt(x)) . Even though <i>x</i><sup>1/2</sup> is mathematically equivalent to <img class="inline" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/rootx.jpg">, the above expression returns the value  false  in a studentâs program. Which of the following is the most likely reason?</img>
A.  Math.pow  returns an  int , while  Math.sqrt  returns a  double .  B.  x  was imprecisely calculated in a previous program statement.  C. The computer stores floating-point numbers with 32-bit words.  D. There is round-off error in calculating the  pow  and  sqrt  functions.  E. There is overflow error in calculating the  pow  function.
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
Any time arithmetic operations are done with floating-point numbers, round-off error may occur. The  Math  class methods such as  pow  and  sqrt  use various approximations to generate their answers to the required accuracy. Since they do different internal arithmetic, however, the round-off will usually not result in exactly the same answers. Note that choice A is not correct because both  Math.pow  and  Math.sqrt  return type  double . Choice B is wrong because no matter how  x  was previously calculated, the same  x  is input to  pow  and  sqrt . Choice C is wrong since round-off error occurs no matter how many bits are used to represent numbers. Choice E is wrong because if  x  is representable on the machine (i.e., hasnât overflowed), then its square root, <i>x</i><sup>1/2</sup>, will not overflow.

Question: 9
9.  What will the output be for the following poorly formatted program segment, if the input value for  num  is  22 ?  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0084-01.jpg"/>
A.  22   B.  4   C.  2 is negative   D.  22 is negative   E. Nothing will be output.
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
Each  else  gets paired with the nearest unpaired  if . Thus when the test  (22 % 5 == 0)  fails, the  else  part indicating that  22 is negative  will be executed. This is clearly not the intent of the fragment, which can be fixed using delimiters:  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0095-01.jpg"/>
#########################################################
Question: 10
10.  What values are stored in  x  and  y  after execution of the following program segment?  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0084-02.jpg"/>
A.  x = 30 y = 90   B.  x = 30 y = -30   C.  x = 30 y = 60   D.  x = 3 y = -3   E.  x = 30 y = 40
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
Since the first test  (x &gt;= 0)  is  true , the matching  else  part,  y = -x , will not be executed. Since  (x &lt;= 100)  is  true , the matching  else  part,  y = x * 2 , will not be executed. The variable  y  will be set to  x * 3  (i.e., 90) and will now fail the test  y &lt; 50 . Thus,  x  will never be altered in this algorithm. Final values are  x = 30  and  y = 90 .
#########################################################
Question: 11
11.  Which of the following will evaluate to true only if boolean expressions  A, B,  and  C  are all false?
A.  !A &amp;&amp; !(B &amp;&amp; !C)   B.  !A || !B || !C   C.  !(A || B || C)   D.  !(A &amp;&amp; B &amp;&amp; C)   E.  !A || !(B || !C)
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
In order for  !(A || B || C)  to be true,  (A || B || C)  must evaluate to false. This will happen only if  A, B , and  C  are <i>all</i> false. Choice A evaluates to true when  A  and  B  are false and  C  is true. In choice B, if any <i>one</i> of  A, B , or  C  is false, the boolean expression evaluates to true. In choice D, if any one of  A, B , or  C  is false, the boolean expression evaluates to true since we have  !(false) . All thatâs required for choice E to evaluate to true is for  A  to be false. Since  true||(any)  evaluates to true, both  B  and  C  can be either true or false.
#########################################################
Question: 12
12.  Assume that  a  and  b  are integers. The boolean expression   !(a &lt;= b) &amp;&amp; (a * b &gt; 0)   will always evaluate to  true  given that
A.  a = b .  B.  a &gt; b .  C.  a &lt; b .  D.  a &gt; b  and  b &gt; 0 .  E.  a &gt; b  and  b &lt; 0 .
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
To evaluate to  true , the expression must reduce to  true &amp;&amp; true . We therefore need  !(false) &amp;&amp; true . Choice D is the only condition that guarantees this:  a &gt; b  provides  !(false)  for the left-hand expression, and  a &gt; b  and  b &gt; 0  implies both  a  and  b  positive, which leads to  true  for the right-hand expression. Choice E, for example, will provide  true  for the right-hand expression only if  a &lt; 0 . You have no information about  a  and canât make assumptions about it.
#########################################################
Question: 13
1.  Given that  a, b , and  c  are integers, consider the boolean expression   (a &lt; b) || !((c == a * b) &amp;&amp; (c &lt; a))   Which of the following will guarantee that the expression is  true ?
A.  c &lt; a  is  false .  B.  c &lt; a  is  true .  C.  a &lt; b  is  false .  D.  c == a * b  is  true .  E.  c == a * b  is  true , and  c &lt; a  is  true .
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
If  (c &lt; a)  is  false, ((c == a*b) &amp;&amp; (c &lt; a))  evaluates to  false  irrespective of the value of  c == a*b . In this case,  !(c == a*b &amp;&amp; c &lt; a)  evaluates to  true . Then  (a &lt; b) || true  evaluates to  true  irrespective of the value of the test  (a &lt; b) . In all the other choices, the given expression <i>may</i> be  true . There is not enough information given to guarantee this, however.
#########################################################
Question: 14
2.  In the following code segment, you may assume that  a, b , and  n  are all type  int .  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0085-03.jpg"/>  What will happen if  a == b  is false?
A.  /*  <i> statement 1 </i>  */  will be executed.  B.  /*  <i> statement 2 </i>  */  will be executed.  C. Either  /*  <i> statement 1 </i>  */  or  /*  <i> statement 2 </i>  */  will be executed.  D. A compile-time error will occur.  E. An exception will be thrown.
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
If  a == b  is false, then  a != b  is true. Thus, the second piece of the compound test must be evaluated before the value of the whole test is known. Since  a == b  is false,  a - b  is not equal to zero. Thus, there is no division by zero, and no exception will be thrown. Also, since the relative values of  a, b , and  n  are unknown, the value of the test  n / (a - b) &gt; 90  is unknown, and there is insufficient information to determine whether the compound test is true or false. Thus, either  /*  <i> statement 1 </i>  */  or  /*  <i> statement 2 </i>  */  will be executed.

Question: 15
3.  Given that  n  and  count  are both of type  int , which statement is true about the following code segments?  I. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0086-01.jpg"/>  II. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0086-02.jpg"/>
A. I and II are exactly equivalent for all input values  n .  B. I and II are exactly equivalent for all input values  n â¥ 1 , but differ when  n â¤ 0 .  C. I and II are exactly equivalent only when  n  =  0 .  D. I and II are exactly equivalent only when  n  is even.  E. I and II are not equivalent for any input values of  n .
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
If  n â¥ 1 , both segments will print out the integers from  1  through  n . If  n â¤ 0 , both segments will fail the test immediately and do nothing.

Question: 16
4.  The following fragment intends that a user will enter a list of positive integers at the keyboard and terminate the list with a sentinel.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0086-03.jpg"/>  The fragment is not correct. Which is a true statement?
A. The sentinel gets processed.  B. The last nonsentinel value entered in the list fails to get processed.  C. A poor choice of  SENTINEL  value causes the loop to terminate before all values have been processed.  D. The code will always process a value that is not on the list.  E. Entering the  SENTINEL  value as the first value causes a run-time error.
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
The  (value != SENTINEL)  test occurs before a value has been read from the list. This will cause  0  to be processed, which may cause an error. The code must be fixed by reading the first value before doing the test:  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0096-01.jpg"/>

A. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0087-02.jpg"/>  B. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0087-03.jpg"/>  C. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0087-04.jpg"/>  D. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0087-05.jpg"/>  E. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0087-06.jpg"/>
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
Here is a trace of the values of  x  and  y  during execution. Note that the condition  (y % x == 1)  is never  true  in this example.  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0096-02.jpg"/>  The  while  loop terminates when  x  is  4  since the test  while (x &gt; 5)  fails.

Question: 18
6.  Which of the following values of  num  will result in  valid  having a value of  true ?
A.  6143   B.  6144   C.  6145   D.  6146   E.  6147
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
The algorithm finds the remainder when the sum of the first three digits of  n  is divided by 7. If this remainder is equal to the fourth digit,  checkDigit , the method returns  true , otherwise  false . Note that  (6+1+4) % 7  equals  4 . Thus, only choice B is a valid number.
#########################################################
Question: 19
7.  What is the purpose of the local variable  nRemaining ?
A. It is not possible to separate  n  into digits without the help of a temporary variable.  B.  nRemaining  prevents the parameter  n  from being altered.  C.  nRemaining  enhances the readability of the algorithm.  D. On exiting the method, the value of  nRemaining  may be reused.  E.  nRemaining  is needed as the left-hand side operand for integer division.
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
As  n  gets broken down into its digits,  nRemaining  is the part of  n  that remains after each digit is stripped off. Thus,  nRemaining  is a self-documenting name that helps describe what is happening. Choice A is false because every digit can be stripped off using some sequence of integer division and mod. Choice B is false because  num  is passed by value and therefore will not be altered when the method is exited. Eliminate choice D: When the method is exited, all local variables are destroyed. Choice E is nonsense.

Question: 20
8.  For ticket-selling purposes, there are three categories at a certain theater. <div class="table-responsive"><table class="table table-bordered"><tr><td> <span class="underline">Category</span> </td></tr><tr><td> 65 or above </td><td> Senior </td></tr><tr><td> From 18 to 64 inclusive </td><td> Adult </td></tr><tr><td> Below 18 </td><td> Child </td></tr></table>  Which of the following code segments will assign the correct string to  category  for a given integer age?  I. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0089-01.jpg"/>  II. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0089-02.jpg"/>  III. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0089-03.jpg"/>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. II and III only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Segment III works because if you enter an age of 90, say,  category  will correctly be assigned  "Senior" , and none of the other  else  pieces of code will be executed. Similarly, if you enter an age corresponding to an adult or a child, only the correct assignment is made. Segment I fails because if you enter an age of 90,  category  will be assigned  "Senior" , but then will be changed to  "Adult"  when the age passes the second test. Segment II uses incorrect syntax. The segment will work if you change the second test to   if (age &gt;= 18 &amp;&amp; age &lt;= 64)

Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
The outer loop produces five rows of output. Each pass through the inner loop goes from  i  down to 1. Thus five odd numbers starting at 9 are printed in the first row, four odd numbers starting at 7 in the second row, and so on. You can picture what is happening in a chart.  <div class="table-responsive"><table class="table table-bordered"><tr><td>  i  </td><td>  j  </td><td class="black"> Steps </td></tr><tr><td>  5  </td><td>  5    4    3    2    1  </td><td> Print 5 odd numbers starting at 9:   9 7 5 3 1  </td></tr><tr><td>  4  </td><td>  4    3    2    1  </td><td> Print 4 odd numbers starting at 7:   7 5 3 1   Stop here!

Question: 23
11.  Consider this program segment.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0092-01.jpg"/>  Which is a true statement about the segment?  I. If  100 â¤ num â¤ 1000  initially, the final value of  newNum  must be in the range  10 â¤ newNum â¤ 100 .  II. There is no initial value of  num  that will cause an infinite  while  loop.  III. If  num â¤ 10  initially,  newNum  will have a final value of  0 .
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. II and III only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
Statement I is false, since if  100 â¤ num â¤ 109 , the body of the  while  loop will be executed just once. (After this single pass through the loop, the value of  num  will be  10 , and the test  if (num &gt; 10)  will fail.) With just one pass,  newNum  will be a one-digit number, equal to  temp  (which was the original  num % 10) . Note that statement II is true: There cannot be an infinite loop since  num /= 10  guarantees termination of the loop. Statement III is true because if  num â¤ 10 , the loop will be skipped, and  newNum  will keep its original value of  0 .

I. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0093-02.jpg"/>  II. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0093-03.jpg"/>  III. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0093-04.jpg"/>
A. I only  B. II only  C. I and II only  D. II and III only  E. I and III only
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
The algorithm works by stripping off the rightmost digit of  n  (stored in  rem ), multiplying the current value of  revNum  by  10 , and adding that rightmost digit. When  n  has been stripped down to no digits (i.e.,  n == 0  is  true ),  revNum  is complete. Both segments II and III work. Segment I fails to produce the right output whenever the input value  n  has a first digit less than (number of digits ? 1). For these cases, the output has the first digit of the original number missing from the end of the returned number.

2.  Which of the following represents correct <i> implementation code </i> for the constructor with parameters?
A. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0119-01.jpg"/>  B. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0119-02.jpg"/>  C.  resetTime(hrs, mins, secs);   D. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0119-03.jpg"/>  E.  Time = new Time(h, m, s);
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Each of the private instance variables should be assigned the value of the matching parameter. Choice B is the only choice that does this. Choice D confuses the order of the assignment statements. Choice A gives the code for the <i>no-argument</i> constructor, ignoring the parameters. Choice C would be correct if it were  resetTime(h, m, s) . As written, it doesnât assign the parameter values  h, m , and  s  to  hrs, mins , and  secs . Choice E is wrong because the keyword  new  should be used to create a new object, not to implement the constructor!

Question: 27
3.  A client class has a  display  method that writes the time represented by its parameter:  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0119-04.jpg"/>  Which of the following are correct replacements for  /*  <i> method body </i>  */ ?  I. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0119-05.jpg"/>  II.  System.out.println(t.hrs + ":" + t.mins + ":" + t.secs);   III.  System.out.println(t);
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. II and III only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Replacement III will automatically print time  t  in the required form since a  toString  method was defined for the  Time  class. Replacement I is wrong because it doesnât refer to the parameter,  t , of the method. Replacement II is wrong because a client program may not access private data of the class.

Question: 28
4.  Which statement about parameters is false?
A. The scope of parameters is the method in which they are defined.  B. Static methods have no implicit parameter  this .  C. Two overloaded methods in the same class must have parameters with different names.  D. All parameters in Java are passed by value.  E. Two different constructors in a given class can have the same number of parameters.
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
The parameter names can be the sameâthe <i>signatures</i> must be different. For example,  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0133-01.jpg"/>  The signatures (method name plus parameter types) here are  print(int)  and  print(double) , respectively. The parameter name  x  is irrelevant. Choice A is true: All local variables and parameters go out of scope (are erased) when the method is exited. Choice B is true: Static methods apply to the whole class. Only instance methods have an implicit  this  parameter. Choice D is true even for object parameters: Their references are passed by value. Note that choice E is true because itâs possible to have two different constructors with different signatures but the same number of parameters (e.g., one for an  int  argument and one for a  double ).

Question: 29
5.  Which of the following correctly constructs a  Date  object in a client class?
A.  Date d = new (2, 13, 1947);   B.  Date d = new Date(2, 13, 1947);   C. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0120-02.jpg"/>  D. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0120-03.jpg"/>  E.  Date d = Date(2, 13, 1947);
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Constructing an object requires the keyword  new  and a constructor of the  Date  class. Eliminate choices D and E since they omit  new . The class name  Date  should appear on the right-hand side of the assignment statement, immediately following the keyword  new . This eliminates choices A and C.

Question: 30
6.  Which of the following will cause an error message?  I. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0121-01.jpg"/>  II. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0121-02.jpg"/>  III. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0121-03.jpg"/>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. II and III only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Segment III will cause a  NullPointerException  to be thrown since  d  is a null reference. You cannot invoke a method for a null reference. Segment II has the effect of assigning  null  to both  d1  and  d2 âobscure but not incorrect. Segment I creates the object reference  d1  and then declares a second reference  d2  that refers to the same object as  d1 .

Question: 31
7.  A client program creates a  Date  object as follows.   Date d = new Date(1, 13, 2002);   Which of the following subsequent code segments will cause an error?
A.  String s = d.toString();   B.  int x = d.day();   C.  Date e = d;   D.  Date e = new Date(1, 13, 2002);   E.  int y = d.year;
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
A client program cannot access a private instance variable.
#########################################################
Question: 32
8.  Consider the implementation of a  write()  method that is added to the  Date  class.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0121-05.jpg"/>  Which of the following could be used as  /*  <i> implementation code </i>  */ ?  I.  System.out.println(month + "/" + day + "/" + year);   II.  System.out.println(month() + "/" + day() + "/" + year());   III.  System.out.println(this);
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. II and III only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
All are correct. Since  write()  is a  Date  instance method, it is OK to use the private data members in its implementation code. Segment III prints  this , the current  Date  object. This usage is correct since  write()  is part of the  Date  class. The  toString()  method guarantees that the date will be printed in the required format.

Question: 33
9.  Here is a client program that uses  Date  objects:  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0122-01.jpg"/>  Which of the following is a correct replacement for  /*  <i> code to get </i>  birthDate */ ?  I. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0122-02.jpg"/>  II. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0122-03.jpg"/>  III. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0122-04.jpg"/>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I and III only
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
The idea here is to read in three separate variables for month, day, and year and then to construct the required date using  new  and the  Date  class constructor with three parameters. Code segment II wonât work because  month(), day() , and  year()  are accessor methods that access existing values and may not be used to read new values into  bDate . Segment III is wrong because it tries to access private instance variables from a client program.
#########################################################
Question: 34
10.  A method in a client program for the  Date  class has the following declaration.   Date d1 = new Date(mo, da, yr);   Here,  mo, da , and  yr  are previously defined integer variables. The same method now creates a second  Date  object  d2  that is an exact copy of the object  d1  refers to. Which of the following code segments will not do this correctly?  I.  Date d2 = d1;   II.  Date d2 = new Date(mo, da, yr);   III.  Date d2 = new Date(d1.month(), d1.day(), d1.year());
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. II and III only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
Segment I will not create a second object. It will simply cause  d2  to refer to the <i>same</i> object as  d1 , which is not what was required. The keyword  new  <i>must</i> be used to create a new object.
#########################################################
Question: 35
11.  The  Date  class is modified by adding the following mutator method:  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0123-02.jpg"/>  Here is part of a poorly coded client program that uses the  Date  class:  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0123-03.jpg"/>  Which will be true after executing this code?
A. A  NullPointerException  is thrown.  B. The  oldDate  object remains unchanged.  C.  recentDate  is a null reference.  D.  recentDate  refers to the same object as  oldDate .  E.  recentDate  refers to a separate object whose contents are the same as those of  oldDate .
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
When  recentDate  is declared in  main() , its value is null. Recall that a method is not able to replace an object reference, so  recentDate  remains null. Note that the intent of the program is to change  recentDate  to refer to the updated  oldDate  object. The code, however, doesnât do this. Choice A is false: No methods are invoked with a null reference. Choice B is false because  addYears()  is a mutator method. Even though a method doesnât change the address of its object parameter, it can change the contents of the object, which is what happens here. Choices D and E are wrong because the  addCentury()  method cannot change the value of its  recentDate  argument.

1.  Here are the private instance variables for a  Frog  object:  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0124-01.jpg"/>  Which of the following methods in the  Frog  class is the best candidate for being a static method?
A. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0124-02.jpg"/>  B. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0124-03.jpg"/>  C. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0124-04.jpg"/>  D. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0124-05.jpg"/>  E. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0124-06.jpg"/>
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
The method  getPondTemperature  is the only method that applies to more than one frog. It should therefore be static. All of the other methods relate directly to one particular  Frog  object. So  f.swim(), f.die(), f.getWeight() , and  f.eat()  are all reasonable methods for a single instance  f  of a  Frog . On the other hand, it doesnât make sense to say  f.getPondTemperature() . It makes more sense to say  Frog.getPondTemperature() , since the same value will apply to all frogs in the class.

3.  The method  reduce()  is not a public method because
A. methods whose return type is  void  cannot be public.  B. methods that change  this  cannot be public.  C. the  reduce()  method is not intended for use by objects outside the  Rational  class.  D. the  reduce()  method is intended for use only by objects outside the  Rational  class.  E. the  reduce()  method uses only the private data fields of the  Rational  class.
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
The  reduce()  method will be used only in the implementation of the instance methods of the  Rational  class. Itâs a private helper method.

Question: 39
4.  The constructors in the  Rational  class allow initialization of  Rational  objects in several different ways. Which of the following will cause an error?
A.  Rational r1 = new Rational();   B.  Rational r2 = r1;   C.  Rational r3 = new Rational(2,-3);   D.  Rational r4 = new Rational(3.5);   E.  Rational r5 = new Rational(10);
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
None of the constructors in the  Rational  class takes a real-valued parameter. Thus, the real-valued parameter in choice D will need to be converted to an integer. Since in general truncating a real value to an integer involves a loss of precision, it is not done automaticallyâyou have to do it explicitly with a cast. Omitting the cast causes a compile-time error.

A. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0126-02.jpg"/>  B.  return new Rational(numer, denom);   C. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0126-03.jpg"/>  D. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0126-04.jpg"/>  E. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0126-05.jpg"/>
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
A new  Rational  object must be created using the newly calculated  numer  and  denom . Then it must be reduced before being returned. Choice A is wrong because it doesnât correctly create the new object. Choice B returns a correctly constructed object, but one that has not been reduced. Choice C reduces the current object,  this , instead of the new object,  rat . Choice D is wrong because it invokes  reduce()  for the  Rational  class instead of the specific  rat  object.

Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
The  plus  method of the  Rational  class can only be invoked by  Rational  objects. Since  n  is an  int , the statement in choice D will cause an error.

C.  t4  represents a Fahrenheit temperature, while  t1, t2 , and  t3  all represent degrees Celsius.  D.  t1  and  t2  refer to the same  Temperature  object;  t3  refers to a  Temperature  object that is 20 degrees lower than  t1  and  t2 , while  t4  refers to an object that is  t1  converted to Fahrenheit.  E. A  NullPointerException  was thrown.
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
This is an example of <i>aliasing</i>. The keyword  new  is used just once, which means that just one object is constructed. Here are the memory slots after each declaration:  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/f0135-01.jpg"/>

Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Notice that  isValidTemp  is a static method for the  Temperature  class, which means that it should be invoked with the class name,  Temperature , as in choice E. The method should not be invoked with  t , a  Temperature  object, as is done in choice C. (Even though  t.isValidTemp  may work, its use is discouraged. A good compiler will give you a warning.) Choice A is not a good choice because it is not robust: It allows the program to proceed with data that may be invalid. Choice B fails because it uses  isNotValidTemp , a method that is not in the program. Choice D fails because  isValidTemp  is not a method of the  TempTest  class.

The formula to convert degrees Celsius <i>C</i> to Fahrenheit <i>F</i> is  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/e0129-01.jpg"/>  For example, 30<sup>Â°</sup> C is equivalent to 86<sup>Â°</sup> F.  An  inFahrenheit()  accessor method is added to the  Temperature  class. Here is its implementation:  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0129-02.jpg"/>  Which of the following correctly replaces  /*  <i> more code </i>  */  so that the postcondition is achieved?  I.  result = new Temperature(degrees * 1.8 + 32, "F");   II. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0129-03.jpg"/>  III. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0129-04.jpg"/>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
A new  Temperature  object must be constructed to prevent the current  Temperature  from being changed. Segment I, which applies the conversion formula directly to  degrees , is the best way to do this. Segment II, while not the best algorithm, does work. The statement   result = result.raise(32);   has the effect of raising the  result  temperature by 32 degrees, and completing the conversion. Segment III fails because   degrees *= 1.8;   alters the  degrees  instance variable of the current object, as does   this = this.raise(32);   To be correct, these operations must be applied to the  result  object.

Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
This is a question about the scope of variables. The scope of the  count  variable that is declared in  main()  extends up to the closing brace of  main() . In  doSomething(), count  is a local variable. After the method call in the  for  loop, the local variable  count  goes out of scope, and the value thatâs being printed is the value of the  count  in  main() , which is unchanged from  0 .

A.  6, 8, 6   B.  8, 6, 6   C.  6, 8, ? , where  ?  means undefined  D.  8, 6, ? , where  ?  means undefined  E.  8, 6, 8
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Recall that when primitive types are passed as parameters, copies are made of the actual arguments. All manipulations in the method are performed on the copies, and the arguments remain unchanged. Thus  x  and  y  retain their values of  6  and  8 . The local variable  temp  goes out of scope as soon as  someMethod  is exited and is therefore undefined just before the end of execution of the program.

2.  Which of the following correctly implements the no-argument constructor of the  SavingsAccount  class?  I. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0154-01.jpg"/>  II. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0154-02.jpg"/>  III.  super();
A. II only  B. I and II only  C. II and III only  D. III only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Implementation I fails because  super()  <i>must</i> be the first line of the implementation whenever it is used in a constructor. Implementation III may appear to be incorrect because it doesnât initialize  interestRate . Since  interestRate , however, is a primitive typeâ double âthe compiler will provide a default initialization of  0 , which was required.

Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
First, the statement  super(acctBalance)  initializes the inherited private variable  balance  as for the  BankAccount  superclass. Then the statement  interestRate = rate  initializes  interestRate , which belongs uniquely to the  SavingsAccount  class. Choice E fails because  interestRate  does not belong to the  BankAccount  class and therefore cannot be initialized by a  super  method. Choice A is wrong because the  SavingsAccount  class cannot directly access the private instance variables of its superclass. Choice B assigns a value to an accessor method, which is meaningless. Choice C is incorrect because  super()  invokes the no-argument constructor of the superclass. This will cause  balance  of the  SavingsAccount  object to be initialized to  0 , rather than  acctBalance , the parameter value.

Question: 51
4.  Which is a correct implementation of the  CheckingAccount  constructor?  I.  super(acctBalance);   II. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0154-07.jpg"/>  III.  deposit(acctBalance);
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. II and III only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
The constructor must initialize the inherited instance variable  balance  to the value of the  acctBalance  parameter. All three segments achieve this. Implementation I does it by invoking  super(acctBalance) , the constructor in the superclass. Implementation II first initializes  balance  to  0  by invoking the no-argument constructor of the superclass. Then it calls the inherited  deposit  method of the superclass to add  acctBalance  to the account. Implementation III works because  super()  is automatically called as the first line of the constructor code if there is no explicit call to  super .

A. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0155-01.jpg"/>  B. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0155-02.jpg"/>  C. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0155-03.jpg"/>  D. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0155-04.jpg"/>  E. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0155-05.jpg"/>
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
First the  withdraw  method of the  BankAccount  superclass is used to withdraw  amount . A prefix of  super  must be used to invoke this method, which eliminates choices B and D. Then the balance must be tested using the accessor method  getBalance , which is inherited. You canât test  balance  directly since it is private to the  BankAccount  class. This eliminates choices A and E, and provides another reason for eliminating choice B.

Question: 53
6.  Redefining the  withdraw  method in the  CheckingAccount  class is an example of
A. method overloading.  B. method overriding.  C. downcasting.  D. dynamic binding (late binding).  E. static binding (early binding).
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
When a superclass method is redefined in a subclass, the process is called <i>method overriding</i>. Which method to call is determined at run time. This is called <i>dynamic binding</i> (p. 147). <i>Method overloading</i> is two or more methods with different signatures in the same class (p. 106). The compiler recognizes at compile time which method to call. This is <i>early binding</i>. The process of <i>downcasting</i> is unrelated to these principles (p. 150).

Question: 54
7.  A program to test the  BankAccount, SavingsAccount , and  CheckingAccount  classes has these declarations:   BankAccount b = new BankAccount(1400);    BankAccount s = new SavingsAccount(1000, 0.04);    BankAccount c = new CheckingAccount(500);   Which method call will cause an error?
A.  b.deposit(200);   B.  s.withdraw(500);   C.  c.withdraw(500);   D.  s.deposit(10000);   E.  s.addInterest();
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
The  addInterest  method is defined only in the  SavingsAccount  class. It therefore cannot be invoked by a  BankAccount  object. The error can be fixed by casting  s  to the correct type:   ((SavingsAccount) s).addInterest();   The other method calls do not cause a problem because  withdraw  and  deposit  are both methods of the  BankAccount  class.

Question: 55
8.  A program to test the  BankAccount, SavingsAccount , and  CheckingAccount  classes has these declarations:   BankAccount b = new BankAccount(1400);    BankAccount s = new SavingsAccount(1000, 0.04);    BankAccount c = new CheckingAccount(500);   In order to test polymorphism, which method must be used in the program?
A. Either a  SavingsAccount  constructor or a  CheckingAccount  constructor  B.  addInterest   C.  deposit   D.  withdraw   E.  getBalance
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
The  withdraw  method is the only method that has one implementation in the superclass and a <i>different</i> implementation in a subclass. Polymorphism is the mechanism of selecting the correct method from the different possibilities in the class hierarchy. Notice that the  deposit  method, for example, is available to objects of all three bank account classes, but itâs the <i>same</i> code in all three cases. So polymorphism isnât tested.

Question: 56
9.  A new method is added to the  BankAccount  class.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0156-01.jpg"/>  A program has these declarations:   BankAccount b = new BankAccount(650);    SavingsAccount timsSavings = new SavingsAccount(1500, 0.03);    CheckingAccount daynasChecking = new CheckingAccount(2000);   Which of the following will transfer money from one account to another without error?  I.  b.transfer(timsSavings, 50);   II.  timsSavings.transfer(daynasChecking, 30);   III.  daynasChecking.transfer(b, 55);
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I, II, and III  E. None
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
It is OK to use  timsSavings  and  daynasChecking  as parameters since each of these <i>is-a</i>  BankAccount  object. It is also OK for  timsSavings  and  daynasChecking  to call the  transfer  method (statements II and III), since they inherit this method from the  BankAccount  superclass.

Question: 57
10.  Consider these class declarations.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0157-01.jpg"/>  Which is a true statement?  I.  Teacher  inherits the constructors of  Person .  II.  Teacher  can add new methods and private instance variables.  III.  Teacher  can override existing private methods of  Person .
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. II and III only
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Statement I is false: A subclass must specify its own constructors. Otherwise the compiler will generate a default constructor that calls the no-argument constructor of the superclass. Note that statement III is false: Private instance methods cannot be overridden.
#########################################################
Question: 58
1.  Which statement about subclass methods is false?
A. Writing two subclass methods with the same name but different parameters is called method overriding.  B. A public method in a subclass that is not in its superclass is not accessible by the superclass.  C. A private method in a superclass is not inherited by its subclass.  D. Two different subclasses of the same superclass inherit the same methods of the superclass.  E. If  Class1  is a superclass of  Class2 , and  Class2  is a superclass of  Class3 , and  Class2  has no overridden methods,  Class3  inherits all the public methods of  Class1 .
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
What is described in choice A is an example of overloaded methods. A key point is that one method is in the same class as the other method, and therefore cannot be an overridden method. An overridden method in a subclass has the same header as a method in its superclass, but different implementation.

Question: 59
2.  Consider a program to manipulate digital images. The inheritance hierarchy is as follows.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/f0158-01.jpg"/>  You may assume that  DigitalPicture  and  Picture  have no-argument constructors, but that  Landscape  and  Portrait  do not have any constructors. Which of the following declarations will compile?  I.  DigitalPicture p = new Portrait();   II.  Landscape p = new Picture();   III.  DigitalPicture p = new DigitalPicture();
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I and III only
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Declaration I works because a  Portrait  <i>is-a</i>  DigitalPicture , and the compiler will generate a default constructor from  Picture , its superclass. Declaration II fails because a  Picture  is <i>not</i> a  Landscape . Declaration III works because  DigitalPicture  <i>is-a</i>  DigitalPicture .

3.  Consider the following hierarchy of classes.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/f0159-01.jpg"/>  A program is written to print data about various birds:  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0159-01.jpg"/>  Assuming that all of the given classes have no-argument constructors, which of the following segments of  /*  <i> more code </i>  */  will cause an error?
A.  printBirdCall(bird2);   B.  printName(parrot2);   C.  printName(bird2);   D.  printBirdCall(parrot2);   E.  printBirdCall(parrot1);
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
There is a quick test you can do to find the answer to this question: Test the <i>is-a</i> relationshipânamely, the parameter for  printName  <i>is-a</i>  Bird ? and the parameter for  printBirdCall  <i>is-a</i>  Parrot ? Note that to get the type of the actual parameter, you must look at its left-hand-side declaration. Choice A fails the test:  bird2  <i>is-a</i>  Parrot ? The variable  bird2  is declared a  Bird , which is not necessarily a  Parrot . Each other choice passes the test: Choice B:  parrot2  <i>is-a</i>  Bird . Choice C:  bird2  <i>is-a</i>  Bird . Choice D:  parrot2  <i>is-a</i>  Parrot . Choice E:  parrot1  <i>is-a</i>  Parrot .

Question: 61
4.  The  method1  method in  ClassB  is an example of
A. method overloading.  B. method overriding.  C. polymorphism.  D. data encapsulation.  E. procedural abstraction.
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Method overriding occurs whenever a method in a superclass is redefined in a subclass. Method overloading is a method in the same class that has the same name but different parameter types. Polymorphism is when the correct overridden method is called for a particular subclass object during run time. Data encapsulation is when data and methods of an object are combined in a class so that the data can be hidden. Procedural abstraction is using separate methods to encapsulate each task in a class.

Question: 62
5.  Consider the following declarations in a client class.   ClassA ob1 = new ClassA();    ClassA ob2 = new ClassB();    ClassB ob3 = new ClassB();   Which of the following method calls will cause an error?  I.  ob1.method3();   II.  ob2.method3();   III.  ob3.method2();
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
Both method calls I and II will cause errors.  I: An object of a superclass does not have access to a new method of its subclass.  II:  ob2  is declared to be of type  ClassA , so a compile-time error will occur with a message indicating that there is no  method2  in  ClassA . Casting  ob2  to  ClassB  would correct the problem. (Note: Class casting is no longer included in the AP Java subset.)  III is correct because a subclass inherits all the public methods of its superclass.

Question: 63
6.  A program that tests these classes has the following declarations and assignments:   Solid s1, s2, s3, s4;    s1 = new Solid("blob");    s2 = new Sphere("sphere", 3.8);    s3 = new RectangularPrism("box", 2, 4, 6.5);    s4 = null;   How many of the above lines of code are incorrect?
A. 0  B. 1  C. 2  D. 3  E. 4
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
All are correct! They all pass the <i>is-a</i> test: (a  Solid  <i>is-a</i>  Solid , a  Sphere  <i>is-a</i>  Solid , a  RectangularPrism  <i>is-a</i>  Solid) ; and the parameters all match the constructors. Note that the default value for  s4  is  null , so the assignment  s4 = null  is redundant (but correct).

Question: 64
7.  Here is a program that prints the volume of a solid:  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0162-02.jpg"/>  Which is a true statement about this program?
A. It will output the volume of the sphere or box, as intended.  B. It will output the volume of the default  Solid s , which is neither a sphere nor a box.  C. It will randomly print the volume of a sphere or a box.  D. A run-time error will occur because it is not specified whether  s  is a sphere or a box.  E. A run-time error will occur because of parameter type mismatch in the method call  printVolume(sol) .
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
This is an example of polymorphism: The correct  volume  method is selected at run time. The parameter expected for  printVolume  is a  Solid  reference, which is what it gets in  main() . The reference  sol  will refer either to a  Sphere  or a  RectangularPrism  object depending on the outcome of the coin flip. Since a  Sphere  is a  Solid  and a  RectangularPrism  is a  Solid , there will be no type mismatch when these are the actual parameters in the  printVolume  method. (Note: The  Math.random  method is discussed in Chapter 5.)

8.  Consider these class declarations.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0163-01.jpg"/>  Which code segment in a client program will cause an error?  I. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0163-02.jpg"/>  II. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0163-03.jpg"/>  III. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0163-04.jpg"/>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Segment III wonât work because  Player  doesnât have a  compareTo  method. The method call  h1.compareToâ¦  will cause a compile-time error. Also, the  compareTo  method requires an  ExpertPlayer  parameter, but  h2  is a  Player , which isnât necessarily an  ExpertPlayer . Segment II avoids both of these pitfalls. Segment I works because the  Player  class has a  getMove  method.

Question: 66
9.  Consider the following class definitions.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0164-01.jpg"/>  The following code segment appears in a class other than  Animal  or  Dog .  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0164-02.jpg"/>  Which of the following method calls will compile without error?  I.  display(d1);   II.  display(d2);   III.  display(d3);
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
All compile without error. For the method call  display(arg) , the compiler checks that the parameter  arg  <i>is-a</i>  Animal , the type in the methodâs signature. Each of the objects  d1, d2 , and  d3  passes the <i>is-a</i> test.

Question: 67
10.  Consider the following class definitions.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0165-01.jpg"/>  The following code segment appears in a class other than  StrStuff1  and  StrStuff2 .   StrStuff1 p = new StrStuff2();    p.printSub("crab");   What is printed as a result of executing the code segment?
A.  crabab   B.  brab   C.  rabb   D.  abb   E.  ab
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Since the actual type of  p  is  StrStuff2 , the  printSub  method of  StrStuff2 , the subclass, will be called first. This is polymorphism, which calls the method of the actual object during run time. The  String s  is set equal to  "rab" , and the  printSub  method of the superclass,  StrStuff1 , will be called, namely  printSub("rab") . This gets the substring of  "rab"  starting at position 2, which is  "b" . Then  "b"  is printed. At this point, only  "b"  has been printed. But recall that execution of the subclass method was halted for  super.printSub(s) , so this method must now be completed by executing  System.out.print("rab") .  Whew!  To recap, here is the order of execution of the statements:  â  Set local  String s  to  "rab" .  â  Call the superclass  printSub("rab") .  â  Set local  s  variable in superclass method to  "b" .  â  Print  "b" .  â  Print the value of  s  in the subclass methodânamely,  "rab" .  â  So, the output is  "brab" .

Consider the following class definitions.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0166-01.jpg"/>  The following code segment appears in a class other than  Class1  and  Class2 .   Class1 c = new Class2();    c.doSomething(8);   What is printed as a result of executing the code segment?
A.  416   B.  422   C.  714   D.  716   E.  722
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
As in the previous question, the method in the subclass will be executed first. Here is the order of execution of the statements:  â   super.doSomething(11)   â   n  is set equal to  7 .  â  Print  7 .  â  Go back to finish  doSomething  in  Class2 . (Note that the parameter in this method is  8 .)  â   n  is set equal to  16 .  â  Print  16 .  Therefore, what gets printed is  716 .

1.  Consider the following declarations in a program to find the quantity  base<sup>exp</sup> .  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0185-01.jpg"/>  Which is a correct replacement for   /*   <i>code to find</i>   power ,  <i>which equals</i>   base<sup>exp</sup> */?   I. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0185-03.jpg"/>  II. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0185-04.jpg"/>  III. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0185-05.jpg"/>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I and III only
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
All the  Math  class methods are static methods, which means you canât use a  Math  object that calls the method. The method is invoked using the class name,  Math , followed by the dot operator. Thus segment II is correct, and segment I is incorrect. Segment III will cause an error: Since the parameters of  pow  are of type  double , the result should be stored in a  double .

2.  Consider the  squareRoot  method defined below.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0185-06.jpg"/>  Which  /*  <i> implementation code </i>  */  satisfies the postcondition?  I. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0185-07.jpg"/>  II.  return new Double(Math.sqrt(d.doubleValue()));   III.  return Double(Math.sqrt(d.doubleValue()));
A. I only  B. I and II only  C. I and III only  D. II and III only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
The  Math.sqrt  method must be invoked on a primitive type  double , but auto-unboxing takes care of that in the line   double x = d;   The return type of the method is  Double , and autoboxing takes care of that in the statement   return x;   Segment III fails because you canât use the  Double  constructor to create a new object without using the keyword  new .

3.  Here are some examples of negative numbers rounded to the nearest integer: <div class="table-responsive"><table class="table table-bordered"><tr><td> <span class="underline">Negative real number</span> </td><td> <span class="underline">Rounded to nearest integer</span> </td></tr><tr><td> -3.5 </td><td> -4 </td></tr><tr><td> -8.97 </td><td> -9 </td></tr><tr><td> -5.0 </td><td> -5 </td></tr><tr><td> -2.487 </td><td> -2 </td></tr><tr><td> -0.2 </td><td> 0 </td></tr></table>  Refer to the following declaration.   double d = -4.67;   Which of the following correctly rounds  d  to the nearest integer?
A.  int rounded = Math.abs(d);   B.  int rounded = (int) (Math.random() * d);   C.  int rounded = (int) (d - 0.5);   D.  int rounded = (int) (d + 0.5);   E.  int rounded = Math.abs((int) (d - 0.5));
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
The value -4.67 must be rounded to -5. Subtracting 0.5 gives a value of -5.17. Casting to  int  truncates the number (chops off the decimal part) and leaves a value of -5. None of the other choices produces -5. Choice A gives the absolute value of  d : 4.67. Choice B is an incorrect use of  Random . The parameter for  nextInt  should be an integer <i>n, n</i> â¥ 2. The method then returns a random  int  <i>k</i>, where 0 â¤ <i>k</i> &lt; <i>n</i>. Choice D is the way to round a <i>positive</i> real number to the nearest integer. In the actual case it produces -4. Choice E gives the absolute value of -5ânamely, 5.

4.  A program is to simulate plant life under harsh conditions. In the program, plants die randomly according to some probability. Here is part of a  Plant  class defined in the program:  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0187-01.jpg"/>  Which of the following are correct replacements for  (1)  /*  <i> statement to generate random number </i>  */  and  (2)  /*  <i> test to determine if plant dies </i>  */ ?
A. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0187-02.jpg"/>  B. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0187-03.jpg"/>  C. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0187-04.jpg"/>  D. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0187-05.jpg"/>  E. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0187-06.jpg"/>
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
The statement  double x = Math.random();  generates a random  double  in the range 0 â¤  x  &lt; 1. Suppose  probDeath  is 0.67, or 67%. Assuming that random doubles are uniformly distributed in the interval, one can expect that 67% of the time  x  will be in the range 0 â¤  x  &lt; 0.67. You can therefore simulate the probability of death by testing if <i>x</i> is between 0 and 0.67, that is, if  x  &lt; 0.67. Thus,  x &lt; probDeath  is the desired condition for plant death, eliminating choices A and B. Choices D and E fail because  (int) probDeath  truncates  probDeath  to 0. The test  x &lt; 0  will always be false, and the test  x == 0  will only be true if the random number generator returned exactly 0, an extremely unlikely occurrence! Neither of these choices correctly simulates the probability of death.

5.  A program simulates 50 slips of paper, numbered 1 through 50, placed in a bowl for a raffle drawing. Which of the following statements stores in  winner  a random integer from 1 to 50?
A.  int winner = (int) (Math.random() * 50) + 1;   B.  int winner = (int) (Math.random() * 50);   C.  int winner = (int) (Math.random() * 51);   D.  int winner = (int) (Math.random() * 51) + 1;   E.  int winner = (int) (1 + Math.random() * 49);
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
The expression   (int) (Math.random() * 50);   returns an  int  from 0 to 49. Therefore, adding 1 shifts the range to be 1 to 50, which was required.

6.  Consider the following code segment.   Integer i = new Integer(20);    /*   <i>more code</i>   */   Which of the following replacements for  /*  <i> more code </i>  */  correctly sets  i  to have an  Integer  value of  25 ?  I.  i = new Integer(25);   II.  i.intValue() = 25;   III. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0188-02.jpg"/>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and III only  E. II and III only
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
The  Integer  class has no methods that can change the contents of  i . However,  i  can be reassigned so that it refers to another object. This happens in both segments I and III. Segment II is wrong because  intValue  is an <i>accessor</i>âit cannot be used to change the value of object  i .

7.  Refer to these declarations.   Integer k = new Integer(8);    Integer m = new Integer(4);   Which test(s) will generate a compile-time error?  I.  if (k == m)â¦   II.  if (k.intValue() == m.intValue())â¦   III.  if ((k.intValue()).equals(m.intValue()))â¦
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. II and III only
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Tests I and II both get past the compiler. Test I compiles because  ==  tests the <i>references</i> for equality. To test the values, use  intValue , which Test II does correctly. Test III fails because you canât invoke a method (in this case  equals ) with an  int .

A. No output. A  StringIndexOutOfBoundsException  will be thrown.  B. No output. An  ArithmeticException  will be thrown.  C.  9   D.  "9"   E. An address in memory of the reference  IntObj
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
The  toString  method of the  Integer  class is invoked, which returns a string representing the value of  intObj :  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0206-02.jpg"/>

A. I only  B. II only  C. II and III only  D. I and II only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Here are the memory slots:  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/f0206-01.jpg"/>  Statements II and III are true because the contents of  s1  and  s2  are the same, and the contents of  s3  and  s2  are the same. Statement I is false because  s1  and  s2  are not the same reference. Note that the expression  s1 == s3  would be true since  s1  and  s3  <i>are</i> the same reference.

A.  strA.compareTo(strB) &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; strB.compareTo(strC) &lt; 0   B.  strB.compareTo(strA) &lt; 0 || strC.compareTo(strA) &lt; 0   C.  strC.compareTo(strA) &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; strA.compareTo(strB) &lt; 0   D.  !(strA.equals(strB)) &amp;&amp; strC.compareTo(strB) &lt; 0   E.  !(strA.equals(strB)) &amp;&amp; strC.compareTo(strA) &lt; 0
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
Note that  "TOMATO"  precedes both  "tomato"  and  "tom" , since  "T"  precedes  "t" . Also,  "tom"  precedes  "tomato"  since the length of  "tom"  is less than the length of  "tomato" . Therefore each of the following is true:   strA.compareTo(strB) &lt; 0    strA.compareTo(strC) &lt; 0    strC.compareTo(strB) &lt; 0   So  Choice A is T and F, which evaluates to F.  Choice B is F or F, which evaluates to F.  Choice C is F and T, which evaluates to F.  Choice D is T and T, which evaluates to T.  Choice E is T and F, which evaluates to F.

2.  This question refers to the following declaration.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0190-01.jpg"/>  What string will  str  refer to after execution of the following?  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0190-02.jpg"/>
A.  "sillyst"   B.  "sillystr"   C.  "silly st"   D.  "silly str"   E.  "sillystrin"
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
x  contains the index of the first occurrence of  "m"  in  line ânamely,  2 . (Remember that  "S"  is at index  0 .) The method call  line.substring(10,15)  returns  "silly" , the substring starting at index 10 and extending though index 14. The method call  line.substring(25,27)  returns  "st"  (donât include the character at index 27!). The concatenation operator,  + , joins these.

Question: 80
3.  A program has a  String  variable  fullName  that stores a first name, followed by a space, followed by a last name. There are no spaces in either the first or last names. Here are some examples of  fullName  values:  "Anthony Coppola", "Jimmy Carroll" , and  "Tom DeWire" . Consider this code segment that extracts the last name from a  fullName  variable, and stores it in  lastName  with no surrounding blanks:  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0190-03.jpg"/>  Which is a correct replacement for  /*  <i> expression </i>  */ ?  I.  fullName.substring(k);   II.  fullName.substring(k + 1);   III.  fullName.substring(k + 1, fullName.length());
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. II and III only  E. I and III only
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
The first character of the last name starts at the first character after the space. Thus,  startIndex  for  substring  must be  k+1 . This eliminates expression I. Expression II takes all the characters from position  k+1  to the end of the  fullName  string, which is correct. Expression III takes all the characters from position  k+1  to position  fullName.length()-1 , which is also correct.

Question: 81
4.  One of the rules for converting English to Pig Latin states: If a word begins with a consonant, move the consonant to the end of the word and add "ay". Thus "dog" becomes "ogday," and "crisp" becomes "rispcay". Suppose  s  is a  String  containing an English word that begins with a consonant. Which of the following creates the correct corresponding word in Pig Latin? Assume the declarations   String ayString = "ay";    String pigString;
A. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0191-02.jpg"/>  B. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0191-03.jpg"/>  C. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0191-04.jpg"/>  D. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0191-05.jpg"/>  E. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0191-06.jpg"/>
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Suppose  s  contains  "cat" . You want  pigString = "at" + "c" + "ay" . Now the string  "at"  is the substring of  s  starting at position 1 and ending at position  s.length()-1 . The correct substring call for this piece of the word is  s.substring(1,s.length()) , which eliminates choices A, C, and D. (Recall that the first parameter is the starting position, and the second parameter is one position past the last index of the substring.) The first letter of the wordâ "c"  in the exampleâstarts at position 0 and ends at position 0. The correct expression is  s.substring(0,1) , which eliminates choice B.

Question: 82
5.  This question refers to the  getString  method shown below.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0191-07.jpg"/>  Which is true about  getString ? It may return a string that  I. Is equal to  s2 .  II. Has no characters in common with  s2 .  III. Is equal to  s1 .
A. I and III only  B. II and III only  C. I and II only  D. I, II, and III  E. None is true.
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
Statement I is true whenever  s2  occurs in  s1 . For example, if strings  s1 = "catastrophe"  and  s2 = "cat" , then  getString  returns  "cat" . Statement II will never happen. If  s2  is not contained in  s1 , the  indexOf  call will return  -1 . Using a negative integer as the first parameter of  substring  will cause a  StringIndexOutOfBoundsException . Statement III will be true whenever  s1  equals  s2 .

Question: 83
6.  Consider this method.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0192-01.jpg"/>  Which of the following is the most precise description of what  doSomething  does?
A. It returns  s  unchanged.  B. It returns  s  with all its blanks removed.  C. It returns a  String  that is equivalent to  s  with all its blanks removed.  D. It returns a  String  that is an exact copy of  s .  E. It returns a  String  that contains  s.length()  blanks.
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
The  String temp  represents a single-character substring of  s . The method examines each character in  s  and, if it is a nonblank, appends it to  str , which is initially empty. Each assignment  str += temp  assigns a new reference to  str . Thus,  str  ends up as a copy of  s  but without the blanks. A reference to the final  str  object is returned. Choice A is correct in that  s  is left unchanged, but it is not the <i>best</i> characterization of what the method does. Choice B is not precise because an object parameter is never modified: Changes, if any, are performed on a copy. Choices D and E are wrong because the method removes blanks.

Question: 84
7.  Which is true about the value of  p1.compareTo(p2) ?
A. It equals  true .  B. It equals  false .  C. It equals  0 .  D. It equals  1 .  E. It equals  -1 .
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
The  compareTo  method returns an  int , so eliminate choices A and B. In the implementation of  compareTo , the code segment that applies to the particular example is  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0207-01.jpg"/>  Since 2 &lt; 4, the value  -1  is returned.

Question: 85
8.  Which boolean expression about  p1  and  p3  is true?  I.  p1 == p3   II.  p1.equals(p3)   III.  p1.compareTo(p3) == 0
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. II and III only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Expression III is true: The  compareTo  method is implemented to return  0  if two  Position  objects have the same row and column. Expression I is false because  object1 == object2  returns  true  only if  object1  and  object2  are the <i>same reference</i>. Expression II is tricky. You would like  p1  and  p3  to be equal since they have the same row and column values. This is not going to happen automatically, however. The  equals  method must explicitly be overridden for the  Position  class. If this hasnât been done, the default  equals  method, which is inherited from class  Object , will return true only if  p1  and  p3  are the same reference, which is not true.

Question: 86
9.  Here are three different  swap  methods, each intended for use in a client program.  I. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0196-01.jpg"/>  II. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0196-02.jpg"/>  III. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0196-03.jpg"/>  When correctly used in a client program with appropriate parameters, which method will swap two integers, as intended?
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. II and III only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Recall that primitive types and object references are passed by value. This means that copies are made of the actual arguments. Any changes that are made are made to the <i>copies</i>. The actual parameters remain unchanged. Thus, in methods I and II, the parameters will retain their original values and remain unswapped.  To illustrate, for example, why method II fails, consider the following piece of code that tests it:  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0208-01.jpg"/>  Here are the memory slots before  swap  is called:  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/f0208-01.jpg"/>  Here they are when  swap  is invoked:  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/f0208-02.jpg"/>  Just before exiting the  swap  method:  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/f0208-03.jpg"/>  After exiting,  xObject  and  yObject  have retained their original values:  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/f0209-01.jpg"/>  The reason method III works is that instead of the object references being changed, the object <i>contents</i> are changed. Thus, after exiting the method, the  IntPair  reference is as it was, but the first and second values have been interchanged. (See the explanation of the next question for diagrams of the memory slots.) In this question,  IntPair  is used as a wrapper class for a pair of integers whose values need to be swapped.
#########################################################
Question: 87
10.  Consider the following program that uses the  IntPair  class.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0197-01.jpg"/>  Which is a correct replacement for  /*  <i> code to swap </i>  x  <i> and </i>  y */ ?  I. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0197-02.jpg"/>  II. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0197-03.jpg"/>  III. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0197-04.jpg"/>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. II and III only  E. None is correct.
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
The  swap  method has just a single  IntPair  parameter, which eliminates segment I. Segment III fails because  setFirst  and  setSecond  are used incorrectly. These are mutator methods that change an  IntPair  object. What is desired is to return the (newly swapped) first and second values of the pair: Accessor methods  getFirst  and  getSecond  do the trick. To see why the  swap  code in segment II works, look at the memory slots.  Before the  swap  method is called:  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/f0209-02.jpg"/>  Just after the  swap  method is called:  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/f0209-03.jpg"/>  Just before exiting the  swap  method:  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/f0210-01.jpg"/>  Just after exiting the  swap  method:  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/f0210-02.jpg"/>  After the statements:   x = iPair.getFirst();    y = iPair.getSecond();   <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/f0210-03.jpg"/>  Notice that  x  and  y  have been swapped!

Question: 88
1.  The  compareTo  method implements the standard name-ordering algorithm where last names take precedence over first names. Lexicographic or dictionary ordering of  String s is used. For example, the name Scott Dentes comes before Nick Elser, and Adam Cooper comes before Sara Cooper.  Which of the following is a correct replacement for  /*  <i> more code </i>  */ ?  I. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0199-01.jpg"/>  II. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0199-02.jpg"/>  III. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0199-03.jpg"/>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
The first statement of segment I compares last names. If these are different, the method returns the  int  value  lastComp , which is negative if  lastName  precedes  n.lastName , positive otherwise. If the last names are the same, the method returns the  int  result of comparing first names. Segments II and III use incorrect algorithms for comparing names. Segment II would be correct if the  else  part were   return lastName.compareTo(n.lastName);   Segment III would be correct if the two  return  statements were interchanged.

Question: 89
2.  Which statement about the  Name  class is false?
A.  Name  objects are immutable.  B. It is possible for the methods in  Name  to throw a  NullPointerException .  C. If  n1  and  n2  are  Name  objects in a client class, then the expressions  n1.equals(n2)  and  n1.compareTo(n2) == 0  must have the same value.  D. The  compareTo  method throws a run-time exception if the parameter is null.  E. Since the  Name  class has a  compareTo  method, it <i>must</i> provide an implementation for an  equals  method.
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
It is <i>wise</i> to have an  equals  method that is compatible with the  compareTo  method; namely,  n1.equals(n2)  and  n1.compareTo(n2)==0  have the same value if  n1  and  n2  are  Name  objects. However, nothing in the Java language <i>mandates</i> that if a class has a  compareTo  method, it must also have an  equals  method. Choice A is true. You know this because the  Name  class has no mutator methods. Thus,  Name  objects can never be changed. Choice B is true: If a  Name  is initialized with null references, each of the methods will throw a  NullPointerException . Choice C is true: If  n1.equals(n2)  is true, then  n1.compareTo(n2) == 0  is true, because both are conditions for equality of  n1  and  n2  and should therefore be consistent. Choice D is true: If the parameter is null, the  compareTo  method will throw a  NullPointerException .

3.  What is the output of the following code segment?  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0200-01.jpg"/>
A.  1 3 2 3   B.  2 4 3 4   C.  1 5 8 12   D.  1 5 8 11   E. No output because of an  IndexOutOfBoundsException
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
The algorithm prints the current index of  "o"  in the string, and then creates a new substring containing all remaining characters following that  "o" . Here is the series of substrings and the corresponding output for each (the symbol <img alt="Images" class="inline" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/com.jpg"/> denotes a blank character):  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0211-01.jpg"/>

4.  Consider the following method  removeAll  that creates and returns a string that has stripped its input phrase of all occurrences of its single-character  String  parameter  ch .  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0201-01.jpg"/>  The method doesnât work as intended. Which of the following changes to the  removeAll  method will make it work as specified?
A. Change Line 10 to<br/> while (pos &gt;= -1)   B. Change Line 12 to<br/> str = str + newPhrase.substring(0, pos);   C. Change Line 13 to<br/> newPhrase = newPhrase.substring(pos);   D. Change Line 14 to<br/> pos = phrase.indexOf(ch);   E. Change Line 16 to<br/> str = str + newPhrase.substring(pos + 1);
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Here is a description of the algorithm:  Make a copy of  phrase  in  newPhrase .  Find the first occurrence of  ch  in  newPhrase  ( pos  is the index).  If you found it, concatenate to  str  the characters in  newPhrase  from  0  to  pos-1 .  Change  newPhrase  to contain all characters from  ch  to the end, excluding  ch .  Repeat the process until there are no more occurrences of  ch  in  newPhrase .  So Line 12 is wrong because  newPhrase.substring(0,pos-1)  will not include the character at  pos-1 , which means that the string returned will lose a character that is <i>not</i> equal to  ch .

Question: 92
5.  A programmer has written a program that "chats" to a human user based on statements that the human inputs. The program contains a method  findKeyWord  that searches an input statement for a given keyword. The  findKeyWord  method contains the following line of code.   pos = statement.indexOf(word);   Suppose  pos  has a value  &gt;= 0 ; that is,  word  was found. The programmer now wants to test that an actual word was found, not part of another word. For example, if "cat" is the keyword, the programmer needs to check that itâs not part of "catch" or "category." Here is the code that tests if  word  is a stand-alone word. (You may assume that  statement  is all lowercase and contains only letters and blanks.)  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0202-02.jpg"/>  Which replacement for  /*  <i> test </i>  */  will give the desired result?
A.  (before &lt; "a" || before &gt; "z") &amp;&amp; (after &lt; "a" || after &gt; "z")   B.  (before &gt; "a" || before &lt; "z") &amp;&amp; (after &gt; "a" || after &lt; "z")   C. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0202-03.jpg"/>  D. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0202-04.jpg"/>  E. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0202-05.jpg"/>
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
The program has found a stand-alone word if the characters  before  and  after  are both blank. Choice E tests that they are not letters between  "a"  and  "z" ; i.e., they must be blank. Choices A and B fail because you must use  compareTo  for inequality tests on strings. Choices C and D allow at least one of  before  and  after  to be a letter, which would mean that  word  was not a stand-alone word.

6.  A program that simulates a conversation between a computer and a human user generates a random response to a userâs comment. All possible responses that the computer can generate are stored in an array of  String  called  allResponses . The method given below,  getResponse , returns a random response string from the array.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0203-01.jpg"/>  Which is a correct  /*  <i> implementation </i>  */ ?
A. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0203-02.jpg"/>  B.  return (String) (Math.random() * allResponses.length);   C. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0203-03.jpg"/>  D. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0203-04.jpg"/>  E.  return (int) (Math.random() * allResponses.length);
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
The first line in choice A returns a random integer that lies between 0 and  allResponses.length-1 . This range corresponds to the range of the array indexes and so it is correct. Choice B is wrongâyou cannot cast a real number to a string. Choice C fails because  Math.random()  is type  double  and you require an  int ; you must do the cast to  int  shown in choice A. Choice D fails because the element  allResponses[allResponses.length-1]  will never be returned:  i  will contain a random  int  from  0  to  allResponses.length-2 . Choice E returns an  int , not a  String .

7.  The  Tile  class contains a  toString  method that creates a  String  containing the letter and point value of a  Tile . The string should be in the following format.   Letter letter (point value = pointValue )   For example,   Letter A (point value = 1)    Letter Z (point value = 10)   Consider the  toString  method below.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0204-03.jpg"/>  Which  /* code */  leads to correct output?
A.  Letter + "letter " + "(point value = " + pointValue + ")";   B.  "Letter " + letter + ("point value = " + pointValue);   C.  Letter + this.letter + " (point value = " + pointValue + ")";   D.  "Letter " + letter + " (point value = " + (String) pointValue + ")";   E.  "Letter " + letter + " (point value = " + pointValue + ")";
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
The actual letter and its point value must not be in quotes because their <i>values</i> must be printed. Everything else, including the parentheses, must be in quotes. (All text in quotes is printed literally, as is.) Choices A and C fail because they donât place the opening word,  Letter , in quotes. Choice B doesnât have the parentheses in quotes. Choice D incorrectly tries to cast an  int  to a  String .

Question: 95
8.  Any two tiles in the word game that have the same letter also have the same point value, but the opposite is not necessarily true. For example, all the vowels have a point value of 1. Two tiles are said to match if they have the same letter. Consider the following  matches  method for the  Tile  class.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0204-04.jpg"/>  Which replacements for  /*  <i> code </i>  */  return the desired result? Note: You may not assume that the  Tile  class has its own  equals  method.  I.  letter == otherTile.letter   II.  this.equals(otherTile)   III.  letter.equals(otherTile.letter)
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. II and III only  E. I and III only
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Segment I will only be true if an object and its parameter are the same reference, which is not necessarily true for two matching tiles. Segment II fails similarly if the  Tile  class doesnât have its own  equals  method. (The inherited method from  Object  compares references.)

Question: 96
1.  A program that reads in a five-digit identification number is to be written. The specification does not state whether zero can be entered as a first digit. The programmer should
A. write the code to accept zero as a first digit since zero is a valid digit.  B. write the code to reject zero as a first digit since five-digit integers do not start with zero.  C. eliminate zero as a possibility for any of the digits.  D. treat the identification number as a four-digit number if the user enters a number starting with zero.  E. check with the writer of the specification whether zero is acceptable as a first digit.
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
A programmer should never make unilateral decisions about a program specification. When in doubt, check with the person who wrote the specification.

A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
In I and II a three-digit number is the object being manipulated. For III, however, the object is a six-character string, suggesting a class other than a  ThreeDigitNumber .

Question: 98
3.  Top-down programming is illustrated by which of the following?
A. Writing a program from top to bottom in Java  B. Writing an essay describing how the program will work, without including any Java code  C. Using driver programs to test all methods in the order that theyâre called in the program  D. Writing and testing the lowest level methods first and then combining them to form appropriate abstract operations  E. Writing the program in terms of the operations to be performed and then refining these operations by adding more detail
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Top-down programming consists of listing the methods for the main object and then using stepwise refinement to break each method into a list of subtasks. Eliminate choices A, C, and D: Top-down programming refers to the design and planning stage and does not involve any actual writing of code. Choice B is closer to the mark, but "top-down" implies a list of operations, not an essay describing the methods.

5.  A list of numbers is stored in a sorted array. It is required that the list be maintained in sorted order. This requirement leads to inefficient execution for which of the following processes?  I. Summing the five smallest numbers in the list  II. Finding the maximum value in the list  III. Inserting and deleting numbers
A. I only  B. III only  C. II and III only  D. I and III only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
A process that causes excessive data movement is inefficient. Inserting an element into its correct (sorted) position involves moving elements to create a slot for this element. In the worst case, the new element must be inserted into the first slot, which involves moving every element up one slot. Similarly, deleting an element involves moving elements down a slot to close the "gap." In the worst case, where the first element is deleted, all elements in the array will need to be moved. Summing the five smallest elements in the list means summing the first five elements. This requires no testing of elements and no excessive data movement, so it is efficient. Finding the maximum value in a sorted list is very fastâjust select the element at the appropriate end of the list.

Question: 101
6.  Which of the following is not necessarily a feature of a robust program?
A. Does not allow execution to proceed with invalid data  B. Uses algorithms that give correct answers for extreme data values  C. Will run on any computer without modification  D. Will not allow division by zero  E. Will anticipate the types of errors that users of the program may make
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
"Robustness" implies the ability to handle all data input by the user and to give correct answers even for extreme values of data. A program that is not robust may well run on another computer without modification, and a robust program may need modification before it can run on another computer.

Question: 102
7.  A certain freight company charges its customers for shipping overseas according to this scale.  $80 per ton for a weight of 10 tons or less  $40 per ton for each additional ton over 10 tons but not exceeding 25 tons  $30 per ton for each additional ton over 25 tons  For example, to ship a weight of 12 tons will cost 10(80) + 2(40) = $880. To ship 26 tons will cost 10(80) + 15(40) + 1(30) = $1430.  A method takes as parameter an integer that represents a valid shipping weight and outputs the charge for the shipment. Which of the following is the smallest set of input values for shipping weights that will adequately test this method?
A. 10, 25  B. 5, 15, 30  C. 5, 10, 15, 25, 30  D. 0, 5, 10, 15, 25, 30  E. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Eliminate choice D because 0 is an invalid weight, and you may infer from the method description that invalid data have already been screened out. Eliminate choice E because it tests two values in the range 10â25. (This is not wrong, but choice C is better.) Eliminate choice A since it tests only the endpoint values. Eliminate B because it tests <i>no</i> endpoint values.

Question: 103
8.  A code segment calculates the mean of values stored in integers  n1, n2, n3 , and  n4  and stores the result in  average , which is of type  double . What kind of error is caused with this statement?   double average = n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 / (double) 4;
A. Logic  B. Run-time  C. Overflow  D. Syntax  E. Type mismatch
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
The statement is syntactically correct, but as written it will not find the mean of the integers. The bug is therefore an intent or logic error. To execute as intended, the statement needs parentheses:    double average = (n1 + n2 + n3 + n4) / (double) 4;

Question: 104
9.  A program evaluates binary arithmetic expressions that are read from an input file. All of the operands are integers, and the only operators are  +, -, * , and  / . In writing the program, the programmer forgot to include a test that checks whether the right-hand operand in a division expression equals zero. When will this oversight be detected by the computer?
A. At compile time  B. While editing the program  C. As soon as the data from the input file is read  D. During evaluation of the expressions  E. When at least one incorrect value for the expressions is output
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
The error that occurs is a run-time error caused by an attempt to divide by zero ( ArithmeticException ). Donât be fooled by choice C. Simply reading an expression  8/0  from the input file wonât cause the error. Note that if the operands were of type  double , the correct answer would be E. In this case, dividing by zero does not cause an exception; it gives an answer of  Infinity . Only on inspecting the output would it be clear that something was wrong.

Question: 105
10.  A programmer plans to write a program that simulates various games. In the program, there is a  Player  class that has a  getMove  method. Method  getMove  returns an  int  value to simulate a move in a game.  Which of the games described below are suitable candidates for using the  getMove  method as specified above?  I. High-Low Guessing Game: The computer thinks of a number and the player who guesses it with the least number of guesses wins. After each guess, the computer tells whether its number is higher or lower than the playerâs guess.  II. Chips: Start with a pile of chips. Each player, in turn, removes some number of chips, but not all of them. The winner is the one who removes the final chip.  III. Tic-Tac-Toe: Two players alternate placing "X" or "O" on a 3 Ã 3 grid. The first player to get three in a row, where a row can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal, wins.
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
Games I and II are perfect games for using an integer value to describe the next move. For the High-Low Guessing Game,  getMove()  will return the next guess, and for Chips,  getMove()  will return the number of chips removed at the playerâs turn. Game III, Tic-Tac-Toe, requires a location on a 3 Ã 3 grid as a playerâs next move: a simple integer value isnât a suitable return type for the  getMove  method.

Question: 106
11.  Which best describes the precondition of a method? It is an assertion that
A. describes precisely the conditions that must be true at the time the method is called.  B. initializes the parameters of the method.  C. describes the effect of the method on its postcondition.  D. explains what the method does.  E. states what the initial values of the local variables in the method must be.
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
A precondition does not concern itself with the action of the method, the local variables, the algorithm, or the postcondition. Nor does it initialize the parameters. It simply asserts what must be true directly before execution of the method.

Question: 107
1.  Consider the following code fragment.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0229-01.jpg"/>  For this algorithm, which of the following initial setups for  a1, a2 , and  a3  will cause   (1) the least number of computer operations (best case) and   (2) the greatest number of computer operations (worst case)?
A. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0229-02.jpg"/>  B. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0229-03.jpg"/>  C. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0229-04.jpg"/>  D. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0229-05.jpg"/>  E. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0229-06.jpg"/>
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
The best case causes the fewest computer operations, and the worst case leads to the maximum number of operations. In the given algorithm, the initial test  if (a1 &gt; a2)  and the assignment to  max  will occur irrespective of which value is the largest. The second test,  if (max &lt; a3) , will also always occur. The final statement,  max = a3 , will occur only if the largest value is in  a3 ; thus, this represents the worst case. So the best case must have the biggest value in  a1  or  a2 .

Question: 108
2.  Refer to the following code segment.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0229-07.jpg"/>  What is the precondition for the  while  loop?
A.  k â¥ N, sum = 1.0   B.  sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + â¦ + k   C.  k &lt; N, sum = 1.0   D.  N â¥ 1, k = 1, sum = 1.0   E.  mean = sum / N
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
The precondition is an assertion about the variables in the loop just before the loop is executed. Variables  N, k , and  sum  have all been initialized to the values shown in choice D. Choice C is wrong because  k  may equal  N . Choice A is wrong because  k  may be less than  N . Choice E is wrong because  mean  is not defined until the loop has been exited. Choice B is wrong because it omits the assertions about  N  and  k .

3.  The sequence of Fibonacci numbers is 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, â¦. The first two Fibonacci numbers are each 1. Each subsequent number is obtained by adding the previous two. Consider this method.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0230-01.jpg"/>  Which of the following is a correct  /*  <i> assertion </i>  */  about the loop variable  i ?
A.  1 â¤ i â¤ n   B.  0 â¤ i â¤ n   C.  3 â¤ i â¤ n   D.  3 &lt; i â¤ n   E.  3 &lt; i &lt; n+1
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Eliminate choices A and B, since  i  is initialized to  3  in the  for  loop. Choices D and E are wrong because  i  is equal to  3  the first time through the loop.

Question: 110
4.  Refer to the following method.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0230-02.jpg"/>  What is the postcondition for method  mystery ?
A.  total  = <i>a</i> + <i>b</i>  B.  total  = <i>a<sup>b</sup></i>  C.  total  = <i>b<sup>a</sup></i>  D.  total  = <i>a</i> * <i>b</i>  E.  total  = <i>a</i>/<i>b</i>
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
The quantity  a  is being added to  total b  times, which means that at the end of execution  total = a*b .

Question: 111
5.  A program is to be written that prints an invoice for a small store. A copy of the invoice will be given to the customer and will display:   â  A list of items purchased.   â  The quantity, unit price, and total price for each item.   â  The amount due.  Three candidate classes for this program are  Invoice, Item , and  ItemList , where an  Item  is a single item purchased and  ItemList  is the list of all items purchased. Which class is a reasonable choice to be responsible for the  amountDue  method, which returns the amount the customer must pay?  I.  Item   II.  ItemList   III.  Invoice
A. I only  B. III only  C. I and II only  D. II and III only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
It makes sense for an  Item  to be responsible for its name, unit price, quantity, and total price. It is <i>not</i> reasonable for it to be responsible for other  Item s. Since an  ItemList , however, will contain information for all the  Item s purchased, it is reasonable to have it also compute the total  amountDue . It makes just as much sense to give an  Invoice  the responsibility for displaying information for the items purchased, as well as providing a final total,  amountDue .

Question: 112
6.  Which is a false statement about classes in object-oriented program design?
A. If a class  C1  has an instance variable whose type is another class,  C2 , then  C1  <i>has-a</i>  C2 .  B. If a class  C1  is associated with another class,  C2 , then  C1  depends on  C2  for its implementation.  C. If classes  C1  and  C2  are related such that  C1  <i>is-a</i>  C2 , then  C2  <i>has-a</i>  C1 .  D. If class  C1  is independent, then none of its methods will have parameters that are objects of other classes.  E. Classes that have common methods do not necessarily define an inheritance relationship.
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
The <i>is-a</i> relationship defines inheritance, while the <i>has-a</i> relationship defines association. These types of relationships are mutually exclusive. For example, a graduate student <i>is-a</i> student. It doesnât make sense to say a student <i>has-a</i> graduate student!

7.  A Java program maintains a large database of vehicles and parts for a car dealership. Some of the classes in the program are  Vehicle, Car, Truck, Tire, Circle, SteeringWheel , and  AirBag . The declarations below show the relationships between classes. Which is a poor choice?
A. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0232-01.jpg"/>  B. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0232-02.jpg"/>  C. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0232-03.jpg"/>  D. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0232-04.jpg"/>  E. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0232-05.jpg"/>
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Even though itâs convenient for a  Tire  object to inherit  Circle  methods, an inheritance relationship between a  Tire  and a  Circle  is incorrect: It is false to say that a  Tire  <i>is-a</i>  Circle . A  Tire  is a car part, while a  Circle  is a geometric shape. Notice that there is an <i>association</i> relationship between a  Tire  and a  Circle : A  Tire  <i>has-a</i>  Circle  as its boundary.

Question: 114
8.  A Java programmer has completed a preliminary design for a large program. The programmer has developed a list of classes, determined the methods for each class, established the relationships between classes, and written an outline for each class. Which class(es) should be implemented first?
A. Any superclasses  B. Any subclasses  C. All collaborator classes (classes that will be used to implement other classes)  D. The class that represents the dominant object in the program  E. All independent classes (classes that have no references to other classes)
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Independent classes do not have relationships with other classes and can therefore be more easily coded and tested.

Question: 115
9.  A program is to be written that simulates bumper cars in a video game. The cars move on a square grid and are located on grid points (<i>x, y</i>), where <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are integers between ?20 and 20. A bumper car moves in a random direction, either left, right, up, or down. If it reaches a boundary (i.e., <i>x</i> or <i>y</i> is Â±20), then it reverses direction. If it is about to collide with another bumper car, it reverses direction. Your program should be able to add bumper cars and run the simulation. One step of the simulation allows each car in the grid to move. After a bumper car has reversed direction twice, its turn is over and the next car gets to move.  To identify classes in the program, the nouns in the specification are listed:   program, bumper car, grid, grid point, integer, direction, boundary, simulation  How many nouns in the list should immediately be discarded because they are unsuitable as classes for the program?
A. 0  B. 1  C. 2  D. 3  E. 4
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
The word "program" is never included when itâs used in this context. The word "integer" describes the type of coordinates <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> and has no further use in the specification. While words like "direction," "boundary," and "simulation" may later be removed from consideration as classes, it is not unreasonable to keep them as candidates while you ponder the design.
#########################################################
Question: 116
10.  Which operation should not be the responsibility of the  GridPoint  class?
A.  isEmpty  - returns false if the grid point contains a  BumperCar , true otherwise  B.  atBoundary  - returns true if <i>x</i> or <i>y</i> coordinate = Â±20, false otherwise  C.  left - if not at left boundary, change the grid point to 1 unit left of current point   D.  up  - if not at top of grid, change the grid point to 1 unit above current point  E.  get_x  - return <i>x</i>-coordinate of this point
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
A  GridPoint  object knows only its <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates. It has no information about whether a  BumperCar  is at that point. Notice that operations in all of the other choices depend on the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates of a  GridPoint  object. An  isEmpty  method should be the responsibility of the  Grid  class that keeps track of the status of each position in the grid.

Question: 117
11.  Which method is not suitable for the  BumperCar  class?
A. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0234-01.jpg"/>  B. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0234-02.jpg"/>  C. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0234-03.jpg"/>  D. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0234-04.jpg"/>  E. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0234-05.jpg"/>
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
A  BumperCar  is responsible for itselfâkeeping track of its own position, selecting an initial direction, making a move, and reversing direction. It is not, however, responsible for maintaining and updating the grid. That should be done by the  Grid  class.

Question: 118
1.  Which of the following correctly initializes an array  arr  to contain four elements each with value  0 ?  I.  int[] arr = {0, 0, 0, 0};   II.  int[] arr = new int[4];   III. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0265-01.jpg"/>
A. I only  B. III only  C. I and III only  D. II and III only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Segment I is an initializer list which is equivalent to  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0301-01.jpg"/>  Segment II creates four slots for integers, which by default are initialized to  0 . The  for  loop in segment III is therefore unnecessary. It is not, however, incorrect.

2.  The following program segment is intended to find the index of the first negative integer in  arr[0]  â¦  arr[N-1] , where  arr  is an array of  N  integers.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0265-02.jpg"/>  This segment will work as intended
A. always.  B. never.  C. whenever  arr  contains at least one negative integer.  D. whenever  arr  contains at least one nonnegative integer.  E. whenever  arr  contains no negative integers.
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
If  arr  contains no negative integers, the value of  i  will eventually exceed  N-1 , and  arr[i]  will cause an  ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException  to be thrown.

Question: 120
3.  Refer to the following code segment. You may assume that  arr  is an array of  int  values.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0266-01.jpg"/>  Which of the following will be the result of executing the segment?
A. Sum of  arr[0], arr[1] , â¦,  arr[arr.length-1]  will be stored in  sum .  B. Sum of  arr[1], arr[2] , â¦,  arr[arr.length-1]  will be stored in  sum .  C. Sum of  arr[0], arr[1] , â¦,  arr[arr.length]  will be stored in  sum .  D. An infinite loop will occur.  E. A run-time error will occur.
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
The intent is to sum elements  arr[0], arr[1] , â¦,  arr[arr.length-1] . Notice, however, that when  i  has the value  arr.length-1 , it is incremented to  arr.length  in the loop, so the statement  sum += arr[i]  uses  arr[arr.length] , which is out of range.

Question: 121
4.  Refer to the following code segment. You may assume that array  arr1  contains elements  arr1[0], arr1[1] , â¦,  arr1[N-1] , where  N  =  arr1.length .  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0266-02.jpg"/>  If array  arr1  initially contains the elements 0, 6, 0, 4, 0, 0, 2 in this order, what will  arr2  contain after execution of the code segment?
A. 6, 4, 2  B. 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 4, 2  C. 6, 4, 2, 4, 0, 0, 2  D. 0, 6, 0, 4, 0, 0, 2  E. 6, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
The code segment has the effect of removing all occurrences of 0 from array  arr1 . The algorithm copies the nonzero elements to the front of  arr1 . Then it transfers them to array  arr2 .

5.  Consider this program segment.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0267-01.jpg"/>  What is the maximum number of times that  SMALL  can be printed?
A.  0   B.  1   C.  k - 1   D.  k - 2   E.  k
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
If  arr[i] &lt; someValue  for all  i  from  2  to  k, SMALL  will be printed on each iteration of the  for  loop. Since there are  k - 1  iterations, the maximum number of times that  SMALL  can be printed is  k - 1 .

Question: 124
7.  Consider writing a program that reads the lines of any text file into a sequential list of lines. Which of the following is a good reason to implement the list with an  ArrayList  of  String  objects rather than an array of  String  objects?
A. The  get  and  set  methods of  ArrayList  are more convenient than the  []  notation for arrays.  B. The  size  method of  ArrayList  provides instant access to the length of the list.  C. An  ArrayList  can contain objects of any type, which leads to greater generality.  D. If any particular text file is unexpectedly long, the  ArrayList  will automatically be resized. The array, by contrast, may go out of bounds.  E. The  String  methods are easier to use with an  ArrayList  than with an array.
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
Arrays are of fixed length and do not shrink or grow if the size of the data set varies. An  ArrayList  automatically resizes the list. Choice A is false: The  []  notation is compact and easy to use. Choice B is not a valid reason because an array  arr  also provides instant access to its length with the quantity  arr.length . Choice C is invalid because an array can also contain objects. Also, generality is beside the point in the given program: The list <i>must</i> hold  String  objects. Choice E is false: Whether a  String  object is  arr[i]  or  list.get(i) , the  String  methods are equally easy to invoke.
#########################################################
Question: 125
8.  Consider writing a program that produces statistics for long lists of numerical data. Which of the following is the best reason to implement each list with an array of  int  (or  double ), rather than an  ArrayList  of  Integer  (or  Double ) objects?
A. An array of primitive number types is more efficient to manipulate than an  ArrayList  of wrapper objects that contain numbers.  B. Insertion of new elements into a list is easier to code for an array than for an  ArrayList .  C. Removal of elements from a list is easier to code for an array than for an  ArrayList .  D. Accessing individual elements in the middle of a list is easier for an array than for an  ArrayList .  E. Accessing all the elements is more efficient in an array than in an  ArrayList .
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
In order for numerical elements to be added to an  ArrayList , each element must be wrapped in a wrapper class before insertion into the list. Then, to retrieve a numerical value from the  ArrayList , the element must be unboxed using the  intValue  or  doubleValue  methods. Even though these operations can be taken care of with autoboxing and unboxing, there are efficiency costs. In an array, you simply use the  []  notation for assignment (as in  arr[i] = num ) or retrieval ( value = arr[i] ). Note that choices B and C are false statements: Both insertion and deletion for an array involve writing code to shift elements. An  ArrayList  automatically takes care of this through its  add  and  remove  methods. Choice D is a poor reason for choosing an array. While the  get  and  set  methods of  ArrayList  might be slightly more awkward than using the  []  notation, both mechanisms work pretty easily. Choice E is false: Efficiency of access is roughly the same.

10.  The following code segment is to print out a list of addresses.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0270-03.jpg"/>  Which is a correct replacement for  /*  <i> more code </i>  */ ?  I. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0270-04.jpg"/>  II. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0270-05.jpg"/>  III.  System.out.println(addr);
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Since the  Address  class does not have a  toString  method, each data field must explicitly be printed. Segment III would work if there <i>were</i> a  toString  method for the class (but there isnât, so it doesnât!). Segment I fails because of incorrect use of the enhanced  for  loop: The array index should not be accessed.

Question: 128
11.  A client method has this declaration.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0271-01.jpg"/>  Here is a code segment to generate a list of  Student  names only. (You may assume that  allStudents  has been initialized.)  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0271-02.jpg"/>  Which is a correct replacement for  /*  <i> code to print list of names </i>  */ ?
A.  System.out.println(allStudents.getName());   B.  System.out.println(student.getName());   C.  System.out.println(student.getAddress().getName());   D.  System.out.println(allStudents.getAddress().getName());   E.  System.out.println(student[i].getAddress().getName());
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Each  Student  name must be accessed via the  getName()  accessor of the  Address  class. The expression  student.getAddress()  accesses the entire address of that student. The  name  field is then accessed using the  getName()  accessor of the  Address  class.

Question: 129
12.  Here is a method that locates the  Student  with the highest  idNum .  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0272-01.jpg"/>  Which of the following could replace  /*  <i> method body </i>  */  so that the method works as intended?  I. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0272-02.jpg"/>  II. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0272-03.jpg"/>  III. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0272-04.jpg"/>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and III only  E. II and III only
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Both correct solutions are careful not to lose the student who has the highest  idNum  so far. Segment II does it by storing a reference to the student,  highestSoFar . Segment III does it by storing the array index of that student. Code segment I is incorrect because it returns the first student whose  idNum  is greater than  max , not necessarily the student with the highest  idNum  in the list.

Question: 130
1.  Which of the following correctly replaces  /*  <i> more code </i>  */  in the  Transaction  constructor to initialize the  tickList  array?
A.  tickList[i] = new Ticket(getRow(), getSeat(), getPrice());   B.  tickList[i] = new Ticket(theRow, theSeat, thePrice);   C.  tickList[i] = new tickList(getRow(), getSeat(), getPrice());   D.  tickList[i] = new tickList(theRow, theSeat, thePrice);   E.  tickList[i] = new tickList(numTicks);
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
For each  i, tickList[i]  is a new  Ticket  object that must be constructed using the  Ticket  constructor. Therefore eliminate choices C, D, and E. Choice A is wrong because  getRow(), getSeat() , and  getPrice()  are accessors for values <i>that already exist</i> for some  Ticket  object. Note also the absence of the dot member construct.

Question: 131
2.  Which represents correct  /*  <i> code to calculate amount </i>  */  in the  totalPaid  method?
A. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0274-01.jpg"/>  B. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0274-02.jpg"/>  C. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0274-03.jpg"/>  D. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0274-04.jpg"/>  E. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0274-05.jpg"/>
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
To access the price for each  Ticket  in the  tickList  array, the  getPrice()  accessor in the  Ticket  class must be used, since  price  is private to that class. This eliminates choices A and E. Choice B uses the array name incorrectly. Choices D and E incorrectly declare a  Transaction  object. (The method applies to an existing  Transaction  object.)
#########################################################
Question: 132
3.  Suppose it is necessary to keep a list of all ticket transactions. Assuming that there are  NUMSALES  transactions, a suitable declaration would be
A.  Transaction[] listOfSales = new Transaction[NUMSALES];   B.  Transaction[] listOfSales = new Ticket[NUMSALES];   C.  Ticket[] listOfSales = new Transaction[NUMSALES];   D.  Ticket[] listOfSales = new Ticket[NUMSALES];   E.  Transaction[] Ticket = new listOfSales[NUMSALES];
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
An array of type  Transaction  is required. This eliminates choices C and D. Additionally, choices B and D incorrectly use type  Ticket  on the right-hand side. Choice E puts the identifier  listOfSales  in the wrong place.

Question: 133
4.  The following code fragment is intended to find the smallest value in  arr[0]  â¦  arr[n-1] , but does not work as intended.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0275-01.jpg"/>  For the segment to work as intended, which of the following modifications could be made?  I. Change the line    int i = 1;    to    int i = 0;    Make no other changes.  II. Change the body of the  while  loop to  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0275-03.jpg"/>   Make no other changes.  III. Change the test for the  while  loop as follows.    while (i &lt;= n)    Make no other changes.
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
There are two problems with the segment as given:    1.   arr[1]  is not tested.    2.  When  i  has a value of  n-1 , incrementing  i  will lead to an out-of-range error for the  if(arr[i] &lt; min)  test.  Modification II corrects both these errors. The change suggested in III corrects neither of these errors. The change in I corrects (1) but not (2).

5.  Refer to method  match  below.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0276-01.jpg"/>  Assuming that the method has not been exited, which assertion is true at the end of every execution of the  while  loop?
A.  v[0]â¦v[vIndex-1]  and  w[0]â¦w[wIndex-1]  contain no common value,  vIndex  â¤  N  and  wIndex  â¤  M .  B.  v[0]â¦v[vIndex]  and  w[0]â¦w[wIndex]  contain no common value,  vIndex  â¤  N  and  wIndex  â¤  M .  C.  v[0]â¦v[vIndex-1]  and  w[0]â¦w[wIndex-1]  contain no common value,  vIndex  â¤  N-1  and  wIndex  â¤  M-1 .  D.  v[0]â¦v[vIndex]  and  w[0]â¦w[wIndex]  contain no common value,  vIndex  â¤  N-1  and  wIndex  â¤  M-1 .  E.  v[0]â¦v[N-1]  and  w[0]â¦w[M-1]  contain no common value,  vIndex  â¤  N  and  wIndex  â¤  M .
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
Notice that either  vIndex  or  wIndex  is incremented at the end of the loop. This means that, when the loop is exited, the current values of  v[vIndex]  and  w[wIndex]  have not been compared. Therefore, you can only make an assertion for values  v[0]..v[vIndex-1]  and  w[0]..w[wIndex-1] . Also, notice that if there is no common value in the arrays, the exiting condition for the  while  loop will be that the end of one of the arrays has been reached, namely  vIndex  equals  N  or  wIndex  equals  M .

Question: 135
6.  Consider this class.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0277-01.jpg"/>  A client program has this declaration.   Book[] bookList = new Book[SOME_NUMBER];   Suppose  bookList  is initialized so that each  Book  in the list has a title, author, and checkout status. The following piece of code is written, whose intent is to change the checkout status of each book in  bookList .  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0277-03.jpg"/>  Which is true about this code?
A. The  bookList  array will remain unchanged after execution.  B. Each book in the  bookList  array will have its checkout status changed, as intended.  C. A  NullPointerException  may occur.  D. A run-time error will occur because it is not possible to modify objects using the enhanced  for  loop.  E. A logic error will occur because it is not possible to modify objects in an array without accessing the indexes of the objects.
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Objects in an array can be changed in an enhanced  for  loop by using mutator methods of the objectsâ class. The  changeStatus  method, a mutator in the  Book  class, will work as intended in the given code. Choice C would be true if it were not given that each  Book  in  bookList  was initialized. If any given  b  had a value of  null , then a  Null-PointerException  would be thrown.

7.  Which of the following is a correct replacement for   <i> /* declare array of </i> BingoCard */?
A.  int[] BingoCard = new BingoCard[NUMPLAYERS];   B.  BingoCard[] players = new int[NUMPLAYERS];   C.  BingoCard[] players = new BingoCard[20];   D.  BingoCard[] players = new BingoCard[NUMPLAYERS];   E.  int[] players = new BingoCard[NUMPLAYERS];
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
The declaration must start with the type of value in the array, namely  BingoCard . This eliminates choices A and E. Eliminate choice B: The type on the right of the assignment should be  BingoCard . Choice C is wrong because the number of slots in the array should be  NUMPLAYERS , not 20.

Question: 137
8.  Assuming that  players  has been declared as an array of  BingoCard , which replacement for  /*  <i> construct each </i>  BingoCard */  is correct?  I. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0278-03.jpg"/>  II. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0278-04.jpg"/>  III. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0278-05.jpg"/>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and III only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Segment III is the only segment that works, since the enhanced  for  loop should not be used to replace elements in an array. After the declaration    BingoCard[] players = new BingoCard[NUMPLAYERS];   each element in the  players  array is  null . The intent in the given code is to replace each null reference with a newly constructed  BingoCard .

Question: 138
9.  Here are two possible algorithms for shuffling the deck.   Algorithm 1   Initialize an array of  Card  called  shuffled  of length  NUMCARDS .  Set  k  to  0 .  For  j=0  to  NUMCARDS/2-1   - Copy  cards[j]  to  shuffled[k]   - Set  k  to  k+2   Set  k  to  1 .  For  j=NUMCARDS/2  to  NUMCARDS-1   - Copy  cards[j]  to  shuffled[k]   - Set  k  to  k+2    Algorithm 2   Initialize an array of  Card  called  shuffled  containing  NUMCARDS  slots.  For  k=0  to  NUMCARDS-1   - Repeatedly generate a random integer  j  from  0  to  NUMCARDS-1 , until  cards[j]  contains a card not marked as empty  - Copy  cards[j]  to  shuffled[k]   - Set  cards[j]  to empty  Which is a false statement concerning Algorithms 1 and 2?
A. A disadvantage of Algorithm 1 is that it wonât generate all possible deck permutations.  B. For Algorithm 2, to determine the last element shuffled requires an average of  NUMCARDS  calls to the random number generator.  C. Algorithm 2 will lead to more permutations of the deck than Algorithm 1.  D. In terms of run time, Algorithm 2 is more efficient than Algorithm 1.  E. If Algorithm 1 is repeated several times, it may return the deck to its original state.
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
The big defect of Algorithm 2 is that it eventually slows down. This is because every time it selects an empty element, it has to loop again. Each of the other choices is true. In choice A, for example, the element  cards[0]  always moves to  shuffled[0] , eliminating all permutations that have  cards[0]  in a different slot. For choice B, by the time you get to assign the last element, all but two slots of the  cards  array are marked empty. So, on average, you will need to go through  NUMCARDS  tries to find one of those two nonempty slots. For choice C, even though Algorithm 2 is slow, in theory every element in  cards  could land in any given slot in  shuffled . This is not true for Algorithm 1, where the first element never budges out of the first slot. For choice E, because of the precise ordering of elements in Algorithm 1, the array will always eventually return to its original state, assuming there are sufficient iterations.

1.  Consider these declarations.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0280-03.jpg"/>  Which statement will cause an error?
A.  strList.add(ch);   B.  strList.add(new String("handy andy"));   C.  strList.add(intOb.toString());   D.  strList.add(ch + 8);   E.  strList.add(intOb + 8);
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
All elements added to  strList  must be of type  String . Each choice satisfies this except choice E. Note that in choice D, the expression  ch + 8  becomes a  String  since  ch  is a  String  (just one of the operands needs to be a  String  to convert the whole expression to a  String ). In choice E, neither  intOb  nor  8  is a  String .

Question: 141
2.  Let  list  be an  ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;  containing these elements.   2 5 7 6 0 1   Which of the following statements would not cause an error to occur? Assume that each statement applies to the given list, independent of the other statements.
A.  Object ob = list.get(6);   B.  Integer intOb = list.add(3.4);   C.  list.add(6, 9);   D.  Object x = list.remove(6);   E.  Object y = list.set(6, 8);
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
The effect of choice C is to adjust the size of the list to 7 and to add the  Integer 9  to the last slot (i.e., the slot with index  6 ). Choices A, D, and E will all cause an  IndexOutOfBoundsException  because there is no slot with index  6 : the last slot has index  5 . Choice B will cause a compile-time error, since it is attempting to add an element of type  Double  to a list of type  Integer .

3.  Refer to method  insert  below.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0281-01.jpg"/>  Assuming that the type of  element  is compatible with the objects in the list, which is a true statement about the  insert  method?
A. It works as intended for all values of  element .  B. It fails for all values of  element .  C. It fails if  element  is greater than the first item in  list  and works in all other cases.  D. It fails if  element  is smaller than the last item in  list  and works in all other cases.  E. It fails if  element  is either greater than the first item or smaller than the last item in  list  and works in all other cases.
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
If  element  is smaller than the last item in the list, it will be compared with every item in the list. Eventually  index  will be incremented to a value that is out of bounds. To avoid this error, the test in the  while  loop should be   while(index &lt; list.size() &amp;&amp; element.compareTo(list.get(index)) &lt; 0)   Notice that if  element  is greater than or equal to at least one item in  list , the test as given in the problem will eventually be false, preventing an out-of-range error.

Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
Recall that  add(index, obj)  shifts all elements, starting at  index , one unit to the right, then inserts  obj  at position  index .

Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
The value of each  Coin c  in  coins  must be accessed with  c.getValue() . This eliminates choice D.

Explanation:
Code segment III is wrong because the  equals  method is defined for objects only. Since  getValue  returns a  double , the quantities  c.getValue()  and  aCoin.getValue()  must be compared either using  == , or as described in the box on p. 70 (better).

I.  int[][] mat = new int[8][10];   II. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0284-05.jpg"/>  III. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0284-06.jpg"/>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
Segment II is the straightforward solution. Segment I is correct because it initializes all slots of the matrix to 0, a perfect square. (By default, all arrays of  int  or  double  are initialized to 0.) Segment III fails because  r  is undefined in the condition  c &lt; mat[r].length . In order to do a column-by-column traversal, you need to get the number of columns in each row. The outer  for  loop could be   for (int c = 0; c &lt; mat[0].length; c++)   Now segment III works. Note that since the array is rectangular, you can use any index  k  in the conditional  c &lt; mat[k].length , provided that  k  satisfies the condition  0  â¤  k  &lt;  mat.length  (the number of rows).

For example,<br/><img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0288-05.jpg"/>  C. Reflects  mat  through a horizontal line of symmetry. For example,<br/><img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0288-06.jpg"/>  D. Reflects  mat  through a vertical line of symmetry. For example,<br/><img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0288-07.jpg"/>  E. Leaves  mat  unchanged.
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Hand execute this for a 2 Ã 2 matrix.  i  goes from 0 to 0 and  j  goes from 0 to 0, so the only interchange is swap  mat[0][0]  with  mat[1][1] , which suggests choice B. Check with a 3 Ã 3 matrix:   <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0305-04.jpg"/>  The elements to be interchanged are shown paired in the following figure. The result will be a reflection through the minor diagonal.  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0305-05.jpg"/>

Question: 151
2.  Consider a class  MatrixStuff  that has a private instance variable.   private int[][] mat;   Refer to method  alter  below that occurs in the  MatrixStuff  class. (The lines are numbered for reference.)  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0289-02.jpg"/>  The intent of the method  alter  is to remove column  c . Thus, if the input matrix  mat  is  <img class="inline" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0289-03.jpg"/>  the method call  alter(mat, 1)  should change  mat  to  <img class="inline" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0289-04.jpg"/>  The method does not work as intended. Which of the following changes will correct the problem?  I. Change line 10 to    for (int j = c; j &lt; mat[0].length - 1; j++)    and make no other changes.  II. Change lines 10 and 11 to   <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0289-05.jpg"/>   and make no other changes.  III. Change lines 10 and 11 to   <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0289-06.jpg"/>   and make no other changes.
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
The method as given will throw an  ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException . For the matrix in the example,  mat[0].length  is 4. The call  mat.alter(1)  gives  c  a value of 1. Thus, in the inner  for  loop,  j  goes from 1 to 3. When  j  is 3, the line  mat[i][j] = mat[i][j+1]  becomes  mat[i][3] = mat[i][4] . Since columns go from 0 to 3,  mat[i][4]  is out of range. The changes in segments I and II both fix this problem. In each case, the correct replacements are made for each row  i: mat[i][1] = mat[i][2]  and  mat[i][2] = mat[i][3] . Segment III makes the following incorrect replacements as  j  goes from 3 to 2:  mat[i][2] = mat[i][3]  and  mat[i][1] = mat[i][2] . This will cause both columns 1 and 2 to be overwritten. Before inserting zeros in the last column,  mat  will be  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0306-01.jpg"/>  This does not achieve the intended postcondition of the method.

Question: 152
3.  This question refers to the following method.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0290-01.jpg"/>  Now consider this code segment.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0290-02.jpg"/>  Which of the following conditions on a matrix  mat  of the type declared in the code segment will by itself guarantee that   isThere(mat, 2, 2, "$")   will have the value  true  when evaluated?  I. The element in row 2 and column 2 is  "$" .  II. All elements in both diagonals are  "$" .  III. All elements in column 2 are  "$" .
A. I only  B. III only  C. I and II only  D. I and III only  E. II and III only
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
For the method call  isThere(mat, 2, 2, "$") , the code counts how many times  "$"  appears in row 2 and how many times in column 2. The method returns  true  only if  count == SIZE  for either the row or column pass (i.e., the whole of row 2 or the whole of column 2 contains the symbol  "$" ). This eliminates choices I and II.

Question: 153
4.  Consider the following method.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0291-01.jpg"/>  If the current state of a matrix  mat  is  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0291-02.jpg"/>  which matrix will result from the method call  alterArray(mat[2]) ?
A. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0291-03.jpg"/>  B. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0291-04.jpg"/>  C. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0291-05.jpg"/>  D. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0291-06.jpg"/>  E. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0291-07.jpg"/>
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
The matrix  mat  consists of an array of rows,  mat[0], mat[1], mat[2] , each of which is an array. The method  alterArray  swaps the first and last elements of an array, then the second and second-last elements, and so on, until it reaches the middle of the array. The method call  alterArray(mat[2])  performs this series of swaps on row 2 of the matrix, the bottom row, resulting in the matrix in choice D.

5.  The method  changeNegs  below should replace every occurrence of a negative integer in its matrix parameter with 0.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0292-01.jpg"/>  Which is a correct replacement for  /*  <i> code </i>  */ ?  I. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0292-02.jpg"/>  II. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0292-03.jpg"/>  III. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0292-04.jpg"/>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
Segment I is a row-by-row traversal; segment II is a column-by-column traversal. Each achieves the correct postcondition. Segment III traverses the matrix but does not alter it. All that is changed is the local variable  element . You cannot use this kind of loop to replace elements in an array.
#########################################################
Question: 155
6.  A two-dimensional array  rainfall  that contains  double  values will be used to represent the daily rainfall for a given year. In this scheme,  rainfall[month][day]  represents the amount of rain on the given day and month. For example,  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0293-01.jpg"/>  The array can be declared as follows.   double[][] rainfall = new double[13][32];   This creates 13 rows indexed from  0  to  12  and 32 columns indexed from  0  to  31 , all initialized to  0.0 . Row  0  and column  0  will be ignored. Column  31  in row  4  will be ignored, since April 31 is not a valid day. In years that are not leap years, columns  29, 30 , and  31  in row  2  will be ignored since Feb. 29, 30, and 31 are not valid days.   Consider the method  averageRainfall  below.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0293-02.jpg"/>  Which of the following is a correct replacement for  /*  <i> more code </i>  */  so that the postcondition for the method is satisfied?  I. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0293-03.jpg"/>  II. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0293-04.jpg"/>  III. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0293-05.jpg"/>
A. None  B. I only  C. II only  D. III only  E. II and III only
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Since there are 365 valid days in a year, the divisor in calculating the average must be 365. It may appear that segments II and III are incorrect because they include rainfall for invalid days in  total . Since these values are initialized to  0.0 , however, including them in the total wonât affect the final result.

A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
This is similar to the previous question, but in this case segment III is also correct. This is because instead of <i>replacing</i> a matrix element, you are <i>modifying</i> it using a mutator method.
#########################################################
Question: 157
8.  A  Pixel  class has several mutator methods that allow the color of a  Pixel  to be changed. For example,  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0296-01.jpg"/>  Consider a  Picture  class that has a private instance variable  pixels , which is a 2D array of  Pixel  objects. There are also  int  variables  rows  and  cols  that contain the number of rows and columns in the  pixels  array.   A method  removeRed  in the  Picture  class sets the red value of every pixel to zero.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0296-02.jpg"/>  Which is a correct replacement for  /*  <i> code to set red value to 0 </i>  */ ?  I. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0296-03.jpg"/>  II.  pixels[row][col].setRed(0);   III.  pixels[row][col] = 0;
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
Segment I works because  p  is a reference to the element  pixels[row][col] . Changing  p  with a mutator method will change the array. Segment II changes the two-dimensional array directly. Segment III fails because  pixels  is not an array of integers.

Question: 158
9.  Consider a class  MatrixStuff  that has a private instance variable  mat .   private int[][] mat;   The following method uses a vertical mirror down the center of a matrix to reflect the left half of the matrix onto the right. The following two examples show the result of mirroring a two-dimensional array of numbers from left to right vertically. (Another way of saying this is that the right half of the matrix is replaced by a vertical mirror image of the left half.)    Example 1:   <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0297-02.jpg"/>    Example 2:   <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0297-03.jpg"/>  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0297-04.jpg"/>  Which replacement for  /*  <i> element assignments </i>  */  will make the method work as intended?
A.  mat[row][col] = mat[row][width - col];   B.  mat[row][width - col] = mat[row][col];   C.  mat[row][width - 1 - col] = mat[row][col];   D.  mat[row][col] = mat[row][width - 1 - col];   E.  mat[row][width - 1 - col] = mat[col][row];
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Look at Example 2 for this question:  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0307-01.jpg"/>  Now consider one element,  12 , say. It must be replaced by its vertical mirror image  9 , i.e.,  mat[2][3]=mat[2][0] . The value of  width  is  4 . See which expression in the answer choices correctly makes this assignment. Eliminate choices A and D right away because  col  can only have the values  0  and  1  in this algorithm, so  mat[2][3]  will not be assigned. In choice B, when  col  has value  1, mat[2][3]=mat[2][1] , an incorrect assignment. Choice C works: when  row  is  2  and  col  is  0, mat[2][3]=mat[2][0] . In choice E, when  row  is  2  and  col  is  0 , the assignment  mat[2][3]=mat[0][2]  is incorrect.

Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
Method  alter  places a mirror along the major diagonal and reflects the elements from left to right across this diagonal.  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0307-02.jpg"/>  In this algorithm, when  row  is  1, col  can only be  0 , and when  row  is  2, col  takes on the values  0  and  1 . Thus, only three elements are altered:  mat[0][1], mat[0][2] , and  mat[1][2] . (Note that the method assigns values to  mat[col][row] .) These elements are all to the right of the diagonal. Choice A is the only choice that leaves elements to the left of the diagonal unchanged.

Question: 161
1.  Which of the following statements about recursion are true?  I. Every recursive algorithm can be written iteratively.  II. Tail recursion is always used in "divide-and-conquer" algorithms.  III. In a recursive definition, a process is defined in terms of a simpler case of itself.
A. I only  B. III only  C. I and II only  D. I and III only  E. II and III only
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
Tail recursion is when the recursive call of a method is made as the last executable step of the method. Divide-and-conquer algorithms like those used in merge sort or quicksort have recursive calls <i>before</i> the last step. Thus, statement II is false.

A. Only when the length of the input string is less than 15  B. Only when the length of the input string is greater than or equal to 15  C. Only when an empty string is input  D. For all string inputs  E. For no string inputs
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
When  stringRecur  is invoked, it calls itself irrespective of the length of  s . Since there is no action that leads to termination, the method will not terminate until the computer runs out of memory (run-time error).

Question: 164
4.  Refer to method  strRecur .  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0327-02.jpg"/>  When will method  strRecur  terminate without error?
A. Only when the length of the input string is less than 15  B. Only when the length of the input string is greater than or equal to 15  C. Only when an empty string is input  D. For all string inputs  E. For no string inputs
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
The base case is  s.length()  â¥  15 . Since  s  gets longer on each method call, the method will eventually terminate. If the original length of  s  is â¥  15 , the method will terminate without output on the first call.

A. It finds the largest value in  x  and leaves  x  unchanged.  B. It finds the smallest value in  x  and leaves  x  unchanged.  C. It sorts  x  in ascending order and returns the largest value in  x .  D. It sorts  x  in descending order and returns the largest value in  x .  E. It returns  x[0]  or  x[n-1] , whichever is larger.
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
If there is only one element in  x , then  recur  returns that element. Having the recursive call at the beginning of the  else  part of the algorithm causes the  if  part for each method call to be stacked until  t  eventually gets assigned to  x[0] . The pending  if  statements are then executed, and  t  is compared to each element in  x . The largest value in  x  is returned.

Question: 170
10.  Which best describes what the  printString  method below does?  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0329-02.jpg"/>
A. It prints string  s .  B. It prints string  s  in reverse order.  C. It prints only the first character of string  s .  D. It prints only the first two characters of string  s .  E. It prints only the last character of string  s .
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Since the recursive call is made directly following the base case, the  System.out.printâ¦  statements are stacked up. If  printString("cat")  is called, here is the sequence of recursive calls and pending statements on the stack:  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0338-01.jpg"/>  When  printString("") , the base case, is called, the  print  statements are then popped off the stack in reverse order, which means that the characters of the string will be printed in reverse order.

(Recall that <i>a</i><sup>-<i>n</i></sup> = 1/<i>a</i><sup><i>n</i></sup>, <i>a</i> â  0; for example, 2<sup>-3</sup> = 1/2<sup>3</sup> = 1/8.)
A.  (1 / base) * power(base, expo + 1)   B.  (1 / base) * power(base, expo - 1)   C.  base * power(base, expo + 1)   D.  base * power(base, expo - 1)   E.  (1 / base) * power(base, expo)
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
The required code is for a negative  expo . For example,  power(2, -3)  should return 2<sup>?3</sup> = 1/8. Notice that  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/e0338-01.jpg"/>  In general:  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/e0338-02.jpg"/>  This is equivalent to  (1 / base) * power(base, expo + 1) .

2.  Consider the following method.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0330-02.jpg"/>  What would be output following the call  doSomething(3) ?
A.  3211211   B.  1121213   C.  1213121   D.  1211213   E.  1123211
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Each box in the diagram below represents a recursive call to  doSomething . The numbers to the right of the boxes show the order of execution of the statements. Let D denote  doSomething .  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/f0338-01.jpg"/>  The numbers in each box refer to that method call only. D(0) is the base case, so the statement immediately following it is executed next. When all statements in a given box (method call) have been executed, backtrack along the arrow to find the statement that gets executed next. The circled numbers represent the statements that produce output. Following them in order, statements 4, 6, 9, 11, 15, 17, and 20 produce the output in choice C.

Question: 173
3.  A user enters several positive integers at the keyboard and terminates the list with a sentinel ( -999 ). A  writeEven  method reads those integers and outputs the even integers only, in the reverse order that they are read. Thus, if the user enters   3 5 14 6 1 8 -999   the output for the  writeEven  method will be   8 6 14   Assume that the user enters at least one positive integer and terminates the list with â999. Here is the method.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0331-01.jpg"/>  Which  /*  <i> code </i>  */  satisfies the postcondition of method  writeEven ?  I. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0331-02.jpg"/>  II. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0331-03.jpg"/>  III. <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0331-04.jpg"/>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Since even numbers are printed <i>before</i> the recursive call in segment I, they will be printed in the order in which they are read from the keyboard. Contrast this with the correct choice, segment III, in which the recursive call is made before the test for evenness. These tests will be stacked until the last number is read. Recall that the pending statements are removed from the stack in reverse order (most recent recursive call first), which leads to even numbers being printed in reverse order. Segment II is wrong because all numbers entered will be printed, irrespective of whether they are even or not. Note that segment II would work if the input list contained only even numbers.

4.  Refer to the following recursive method.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0332-01.jpg"/>  What value is returned by the call  mystery(3) ?
A. 12  B. 10  C. 8  D. 6  E. 4
Correct Answer:  A

Question: 175
5.  What will be returned by  t(5) ?
A. 4  B. 2  C. 0  D. -2  E. -4
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
The method generates a sequence. The first two terms, <i>t</i>(1) and <i>t</i>(2), are 2 and 4. Each subsequent term is generated by subtracting the previous two terms. This is the sequence: 2, 4, 2, ?2, ?4, ?2, 2, 4, â¦. Thus, <i>t</i>(5) = ?4. Alternatively,  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/e0339-01.jpg"/>

A. 6  B. 7  C. 11  D. 15  E. 25
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
Count them! (Note that you stop at <i>t</i>(2) since itâs a base case.)  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/f0339-02.jpg"/>

7.  This question refers to methods  f1  and  f2  that are in the same class.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0333-02.jpg"/>  What value will be returned by a call to  f1(5, 3) ?
A. 5  B. 6  C. 7  D. 12  E. 15
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
This is an example of <i>mutual recursion</i>, where two methods call each other.  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/e0340-01.jpg"/>  Note that <i>f</i><sub>2</sub>(1,3) is a base case.

Question: 178
8.  Consider method  foo .  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0334-01.jpg"/>  Assuming no possibility of integer overflow, what will be the value of  z  after execution of the following statement? Note that <i>n</i>! = (<i>n</i>)(<i>n</i> - 1)(<i>n</i> - 2)â¦ (2)(1).   int z = foo(foo(3) + foo(4));
A. (15!)/(2!)  B. 3! + 4!  C. (7!)!  D. (3! + 4!)!  E. 15
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
foo(3) = 3 (this is a base case). Also, foo(4) = 4 Ã foo(3) = 12. So you need to find foo(foo(3) + foo(4)) = foo(15).  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/e0340-02.jpg"/>

Question: 179
9.  The method  writeWithCommas  is supposed to print its nonnegative  int  argument with commas properly inserted (every three digits, starting at the right). For example, the integer 27048621 should be printed as 27,048,621. Method  writeWithCommas  does not always work as intended, however. Assuming no integer overflow, which of the following integer arguments will not be printed correctly?
A. 896  B. 251462251  C. 365051  D. 278278  E. 4
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Suppose that <i>n</i> = 365051. The method call  writeWithCommas(365051)  will write  051  and then execute the call  writeWithCommas(365) . This is a base case, so  365  will be written out, resulting in  051,365 . A number like 278278 (two sets of three identical digits) will be written out correctly, as will a "symmetrical" number like 251462251. Also, any <i>n</i> &lt; 1000 is a base case and the number will be written out correctly as is.
#########################################################
Question: 180
10.  Which change in the code of the given methods will cause method  writeWithCommas  to work as intended?
A. Interchange the lines  System.out.print(n / 100)  and  System.out.print(n % 10)  in method  writeThreeDigits .  B. Interchange the lines  writeThreeDigits(n % 1000)  and  writeWithCommas(n / 1000)  in method  writeWithCommas .  C. Change the test in  writeWithCommas  to  if (n &gt; 1000) .  D. In the method  writeWithCommas , change the line  writeThreeDigits(n % 1000)  to  writeThreeDigits(n / 1000) .  E. In the method  writeWithCommas , change the recursive call  writeWithCommas(n / 1000)  to  writeWithCommas(n % 1000) .
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
The cause of the problem is that the numbers are being written out with the sets of three digits in the wrong order. The problem is fixed by interchanging  writeThreeDigits(n % 1000)  and  writeWithCommas(n / 1000) . For example, here is the order of execution for  writeWithCommas(365051) .   <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0340-01.jpg"/>

Consider the following method.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0336-01.jpg"/>  Assume that the screen looks like a Cartesian coordinate system with the origin at the center, and that  drawLine  connects ( x1 , y1 ) to ( x2 , y2 ). Assume also that  x1, y1, x2 , and  y2  are never too large or too small to cause errors. Which picture best represents the sketch drawn by the method call   sketch(a, 0, -a, 0, 2)   where  a  is a positive integer?
A. <img class="inline" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/f0336-01.jpg"/>  B. <img class="inline" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/f0336-02.jpg"/>  C. <img class="inline" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/f0336-03.jpg"/>  D. <img class="inline" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/f0336-04.jpg"/>  E. <img class="inline" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/f0336-05.jpg"/>
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Here is the "box diagram" for the recursive method calls, showing the order of execution of statements. Notice that the circled statements are the base case calls, the only statements that actually draw a line. Note also that the first time you reach a base case (see circled statement 6), you can get the answer: The picture in choice B is the only one that has a line segment joining  (a,0)  to  (a,-a) .  <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/f0341-01.jpg"/>

Question: 182
1.  The decision to choose a particular sorting algorithm should be made based on which of the following?  I. Run-time efficiency of the sort  II. Size of the array  III. Space efficiency of the algorithm
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
The time and space requirements of sorting algorithms are affected by all three of the given factors, so all must be considered when choosing a particular sorting algorithm.

Question: 183
2.  The following code fragment does a sequential search to determine whether a given integer,  value , is stored in an array  a[0]  â¦  a[n-1] .  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0352-01.jpg"/>  Which of the following should replace  /*  <i> boolean expression </i>  */  so that the algorithm works as intended?
A.  value != a[i]   B.  i &lt; n &amp;&amp; value == a[i]   C.  value != a[i] &amp;&amp; i &lt; n   D.  i &lt; n &amp;&amp; value != a[i]   E.  i &lt; n || value != a[i]
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
Choice B doesnât make sense: The loop will be exited as soon as a value is found that does <i>not</i> equal  a[i] . Eliminate choice A because, if  value  is not in the array,  a[i]  will eventually go out of bounds. You need the  i &lt; n  part of the boolean expression to avoid this. The test  i &lt; n , however, must precede  value != a[i]  so that if  i &lt; n  fails, the expression will be evaluated as false, the test will be short-circuited, and an out-of-range error will be avoided. Choice C does not avoid this error. Choice E is wrong because both parts of the expression must be true in order to continue the search.

Question: 184
3.  A feature of data that is used for a binary search but not necessarily used for a sequential search is
A. length of list.  B. type of data.  C. order of data.  D. smallest value in the list.  E. median value of the data.
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
The binary search algorithm depends on the array being sorted. Sequential search has no ordering requirement. Both depend on choice A, the length of the list, while the other choices are irrelevant to both algorithms.
#########################################################
Question: 185
4.  Array  unsortedArr  contains an unsorted list of integers. Array  sortedArr  contains a list of integers sorted in increasing order. Which of the following operations is more efficient for  sortedArr  than  unsortedArr ? Assume the most efficient algorithms are used.  I. Inserting a new element  II. Searching for a given element  III. Computing the mean of the elements
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Inserting a new element is quick and easy in an unsorted arrayâjust add it to the end of the list. Computing the mean involves finding the sum of the elements and dividing by <i>n</i>, the number of elements. The execution time is the same whether the list is sorted or not. Operation II, searching, is inefficient for an unsorted list, since a sequential search must be used. In  sortedArr , the efficient binary search algorithm, which involves fewer comparisons, could be used. In fact, in a sorted list, even a sequential search would be more efficient than for an unsorted list: If the search item were not in the list, the search could stop as soon as the list elements were greater than the search item.
#########################################################
Question: 186
5.  An algorithm for searching a large sorted array for a specific value <i>x</i> compares every third item in the array to <i>x</i> until it finds one that is greater than or equal to <i>x</i>. When a larger value is found, the algorithm compares <i>x</i> to the previous two items. If the array is sorted in increasing order, which of the following describes all cases when this algorithm uses fewer comparisons to find <i>x</i> than would a binary search?
A. It will never use fewer comparisons.  B. When <i>x</i> is in the middle position of the array  C. When <i>x</i> is very close to the beginning of the array  D. When <i>x</i> is very close to the end of the array  E. When <i>x</i> is not in the array
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Suppose the array has 1000 elements and <i>x</i> is somewhere in the first 8 slots. The algorithm described will find <i>x</i> using no more than five comparisons. A binary search, by contrast, will chop the array in half and do a comparison six times before examining elements in the first 15 slots of the array (array size after each chop: 500, 250, 125, 62, 31, 15).

Question: 187
6.  Assume that  a[0]  â¦  a[N-1]  is an array of <i>N</i> positive integers and that the following assertion is true.   a[0] &gt; a[k] for all k such that 0 &lt; k &lt; N   Which of the following <i>must</i> be true?
A. The array is sorted in ascending order.  B. The array is sorted in descending order.  C. All values in the array are different.  D.  a[0]  holds the smallest value in the array.  E.  a[0]  holds the largest value in the array.
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
The assertion states that the first element is greater than all the other elements in the array. This eliminates choices A and D. Choices B and C are incorrect because you have no information about the relative sizes of elements  a[1]â¦a[N-1] .

7.  The following code is designed to set  index  to the location of the first occurrence of  key  in array  a  and to set  index  to -1 if  key  is not in  a .  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0353-02.jpg"/>  In which case will this program <i>definitely</i> fail to perform the task described?
A. When  key  is the first element of the array  B. When  key  is the last element of the array  C. When  key  is not in the array  D. When  key  equals 0  E. When  key  equals  a[key]
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
When  key  is not in the array,  index  will eventually be large enough that  a[index]  will cause an  ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException . In choices A and B, the algorithm will find  key  without error. Choice D wonât fail if 0 is in the array. Choice E will work if  a[key]  is not out of range.

9.  Refer to method  search .  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0355-01.jpg"/>  Assuming that the method works as intended, which of the following should be added to the precondition of  search ?
A.  v  is sorted smallest to largest.  B.  v  is sorted largest to smallest.  C.  v  is unsorted.  D. There is at least one occurrence of  key  in  v .  E.  key  occurs no more than once in  v .
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
The algorithm uses the fact that array  v  is sorted smallest to largest. The  while  loop terminatesâwhich means that the search stopsâas soon as  v[index] &gt;= key .

Question: 191
1.  To find the key value 27, the search interval <i>after</i> the first pass through the  while  loop will be
A.  a[0]  â¦  a[7]   B.  a[5]  â¦  a[6]   C.  a[4]  â¦  a[7]   D.  a[2]  â¦  a[6]   E.  a[6]  â¦  a[7]
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
The first pass uses the interval  a[0]â¦a[7] . Since  mid  = (0 + 7)/2 = 3,  low  gets adjusted to  mid  + 1 = 4, and the second pass uses the interval  a[4]â¦a[7] .
#########################################################
Question: 192
2.  How many iterations will be required to determine that 27 is not in the list?
A. 1  B. 3  C. 4  D. 8  E. 16
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
First pass: Compare 27 with  a[3] , since  low  = 0  high  = 7  mid  = (0 + 7)/2 = 3. Second pass: Compare 27 with  a[5] , since  low  = 4  high  = 7  mid  = (4 + 7)/2 = 5. Third pass: Compare 27 with  a[6] , since  low  = 6  high  = 7  mid  = (6 + 7)/2 = 6. The fourth pass doesnât happen, since  low  = 6 and  high  = 5, and therefore the test  (low &lt;= high)  fails. Using the general rule for finding the number of iterations when  key  is not in the list: If <i>n</i> is the number of elements, round <i>n</i> up to the nearest power of 2, which is 8 in this case. Note that 8 = 2<sup>3</sup>. Since 27 lies between 4 and 41, there will be 3 iterations of the "divide-and-compare" loop.

3.  What will be stored in  y  after executing the following?   int y = binSearch(4);
A.  20   B.  7   C.  4   D.  0   E.  -1
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
The method returns the index of the  key  parameter, 4. Since  a[0]  contains 4,  binSearch(4)  will return 0.
#########################################################
Question: 194
4.  If the test for the  while  loop is changed to   while (low &lt; high)   the  binSearch  method does not work as intended. Which value in the given list will not be found?
A. 4  B. 7  C. 11  D. 24  E. 30
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
Try 4. Here are the values for  low, high , and  mid  when searching for 4:   <img alt="Images" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0365-02.jpg"/>  After this pass,  high  gets adjusted to  mid  ?1, which is 0. Now  low  equals  high , and the test for the  while  loop fails. The method returns ?1, indicating that 4 wasnât found.
#########################################################
Question: 195
5.  For  binSearch , which of the following assertions will be true following every iteration of the  while  loop?
A.  key  =  a[mid]  or  key  is not in  a .  B.  a[low]  â¤  key  â¤  a[high]   C.  low  â¤  mid  â¤  high   D.  key  =  a[mid] , or  a[low]  â¤  key  â¤  a[high]   E.  key  =  a[mid] , or  a[low]  â¤  key  â¤  a[high] , or  key  is not in array  a .
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
When the loop is exited, either  key  =  a[mid]  (and  mid  has been returned) or  key  has not been found, in which case either  a[low]  â¤  key  â¤  a[high]  or  key  is not in the array. The correct assertion must account for all three possibilities.

Question: 196
6.  A large sorted array containing about 30,000 elements is to be searched for a value  key  using an iterative binary search algorithm. Assuming that  key  is in the array, which of the following is closest to the smallest number of iterations that will guarantee that  key  is found? Note: 10<sup>3</sup> â 2<sup>10</sup>.
A. 15  B. 30  C. 100  D. 300  E. 3000
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
30,000 = 1000 Ã 30 â 2<sup>10</sup> Ã 2<sup>5</sup> = 2<sup>15</sup>. Since a successful binary search in the worst case requires log<sub>2</sub> <i>n</i> iterations, 15 iterations will guarantee that  key  is found. (Note that 30,000 &lt; 2<sup>10</sup> Ã 2<sup>5</sup> = 32,768.) Shortcut: 30,000 &lt; 2<sup>15</sup>. Therefore, the maximum (worst case) number of comparisons that guarantees the key is found is equal to the exponent, 15.

8.  When sorted biggest to smallest with  insertionSort , which list will need the fewest changes of position for individual elements?
A. 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9  B. 9, 5, 1, 4, 3, 2  C. 9, 4, 2, 5, 1, 3  D. 9, 3, 5, 1, 4, 2  E. 3, 2, 1, 9, 5, 4
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
An insertion sort compares  a[1]  and  a[0] . If they are not in the correct order,  a[0]  is moved and  a[1]  is inserted in its correct position.  a[2]  is then inserted in its correct position, and  a[0]  and  a[1]  are moved if necessary, and so on. Since B has only one element out of order, it will require the fewest changes.

While typing the  insertionSort  method, a programmer by mistake enters   while (temp &gt; a[j])   instead of   while (j &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; temp &gt; a[j])   Despite this mistake, the method works as intended the first time the programmer enters an array to be sorted in descending order. Which of the following could explain this?  I. The first element in the array was the largest element in the array.  II. The array was already sorted in descending order.  III. The first element was less than or equal to all the other elements in the array.
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. II and III only
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
j &gt;= 0  is a stopping condition that prevents an element that is larger than all those to the left of it from going off the left end of the array. If no error occurred, it means that the largest element in the array was  a[0] , which was true in situations I and II. Omitting the  j &gt;= 0  test will cause a run-time (out-of-range) error whenever  temp  is bigger than all elements to the left of it (i.e., the insertion point is  0 ).

Question: 201
1.  The elements in a long list of integers are roughly sorted in decreasing order. No more than 5 percent of the elements are out of order. Which of the following is a valid reason for using an insertion sort rather than a selection sort to sort this list into decreasing order?  I. There will be fewer comparisons of elements for insertion sort.  II. There will be fewer changes of position of elements for insertion sort.  III. There will be less space required for insertion sort.
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
Look at a small array that is almost sorted:  10 8 9 6 2  For <span class="underline">insertion sort</span>, you need four passes through this array.  The first pass compares 8 and 10âone comparison, no moves.  The second pass compares 9 and 8, then 9 and 10. The array becomes 10 9 8 6 2âtwo comparisons, two moves.  The third and fourth passes compare 6 and 8, and 2 and 6âno moves.  In summary, there are approximately one or two comparisons per pass and no more than two moves per pass.  For <span class="underline">selection sort</span>, there are four passes too.  The first pass finds the biggest element in the array and swaps it into the first position.  The array is still 10 8 9 6 2âfour comparisons. There are two moves if your algorithm makes the swap in this case, otherwise no moves.  The second pass finds the biggest element from  a[1]  to  a[4]  and swaps it into the second position: 10 9 8 6 2âthree comparisons, two moves.  For the third pass there are two comparisons, and one for the fourth. There are zero or two moves each time.  Summary: 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 total comparisons and a possible two moves per pass.  Notice that reason I is valid. Selection sort makes the same number of comparisons irrespective of the state of the array. Insertion sort does far fewer comparisons if the array is almost sorted. Reason II is invalid. There are roughly the same number of data movements for insertion and selection. Insertion may even have more changes, depending on how far from their insertion points the unsorted elements are. Reason III is wrong because insertion and selection sorts have the same space requirements.

Question: 202
2.  Which of the following is a valid reason why merge sort is a better sorting algorithm than insertion sort for sorting long, randomly ordered lists?  I. Merge sort requires less code than insertion sort.  II. Merge sort requires less storage space than insertion sort.  III. Merge sort runs faster than insertion sort.
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. II and III only
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Reject reason I. Merge sort requires both a  merge  and a  mergeSort  methodâ<i>more</i> code than the relatively short and simple code for insertion sort. Reject reason II. The  merge  algorithm uses a temporary array, which means <i>more</i> storage space than insertion sort. Reason III is correct. For long lists, the "divide-and-conquer" approach of merge sort gives it a faster run time than insertion sort.

Question: 203
3.  A large array of lowercase characters is to be searched for the pattern "pqrs." The first step in a very efficient searching algorithm is to look at characters with index
A. 0, 1, 2, â¦ until a "p" is encountered.  B. 0, 1, 2, â¦ until any letter in "p" â¦ "s" is encountered.  C. 3, 7, 11, â¦ until an "s" is encountered.  D. 3, 7, 11, â¦ until any letter in "p" â¦ "s" is encountered.  E. 3, 7, 11, â¦ until any letter other than "p" â¦ "s" is encountered.
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
Since the search is for a four-letter sequence, the idea in this algorithm is that if you examine every fourth slot, youâll find a letter in the required sequence very quickly. When you find one of these letters, you can then examine adjacent slots to check if you have the required sequence. This method will, on average, result in fewer comparisons than the strictly sequential search algorithm in choice A. Choice B is wrong. If you encounter a "q," "r," or "s" without a "p" first, you canât have found "pqrs." Choice C is wrong because you may miss the sequence completely. Choice E doesnât make sense.

Question: 204
4.  The array  names[0], names[1] , â¦,  names[9999]  is a list of 10,000 name strings. The list is to be searched to determine the location of some name  X  in the list. Which of the following preconditions is necessary for a binary search?
A. There are no duplicate names in the list.  B. The number of names <i>N</i> in the list is large.  C. The list is in alphabetical order.  D. Name  X  is definitely in the list.  E. Name  X  occurs near the middle of the list.
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
The main precondition for a binary search is that the list is ordered.

Question: 205
5.  Consider the following method.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/p0360-01.jpg"/>  The method shown is an example of
A. insertion sort.  B. merge sort.  C. selection sort.  D. binary search.  E. sequential search.
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
This algorithm is just a recursive implementation of a sequential search. It starts by testing if the last element in the array,  a[n-1] , is equal to  value . If so, it returns the index  n - 1 . Otherwise, it calls itself with  n  replaced by  n - 1 . The net effect is that it examines  a[n-1], a[n-2] , â¦. The base case,  if (n == 0) , occurs when there are no elements left to examine. In this case, the method returns ?1, signifying that  value  was not in the array.

Question: 206
6.  The  partition  method for quicksort partitions a list as follows.  (i) A pivot element is selected from the array.   (ii) The elements of the list are rearranged such that all elements to the left of the pivot are less than or equal to it; all elements to the right of the pivot are greater than or equal to it.  Partitioning the array requires which of the following?
A. A recursive algorithm  B. A temporary array  C. An external file for the array  D. A swap algorithm for interchanging array elements  E. A merge method for merging two sorted lists
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
The  partition  algorithm performs a series of swaps until the pivot element is swapped into its final sorted position. No temporary arrays or external files are used, nor is a recursive algorithm invoked. The  merge  method is used for merge sort, not quicksort.
#########################################################
Question: 207
7.  Assume that merge sort will be used to sort an array  arr  of  n  integers into increasing order. What is the purpose of the  merge  method in the merge sort algorithm?
A. Partition  arr  into two parts of roughly equal length, then merge these parts.  B. Use a recursive algorithm to sort  arr  into increasing order.  C. Divide  arr  into  n  subarrays, each with one element.  D. Merge two sorted parts of  arr  into a single sorted array.  E. Merge two sorted arrays into a temporary array that is sorted.
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
Recall the merge sort algorithm:   Divide  arr  into two parts.   Merge sort the left side.   Merge sort the right side.   Merge the two sides into a single sorted array.  The  merge  method is used for the last step of the algorithm. It does not do any sorting or partitioning of the array, which eliminates choices A, B, and C. Choice E is wrong because  merge  starts with a <i>single</i> array that has two sorted parts.

Question: 208
1.  A binary search is to be performed on an array with 600 elements. In the <i>worst</i> case, which of the following best approximates the number of iterations of the algorithm?
A. 6  B. 10  C. 100  D. 300  E. 600
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Round 600 up to the next power of 2, which is 1024 = 2<sup>10</sup>. Recall the shortcut: 600 &lt; 2<sup>10</sup>, so the worst case equals the exponent, 10.

Question: 209
2.  A worst case situation for insertion sort would be  I. A list in correct sorted order.  II. A list sorted in reverse order.  III. A list in random order.
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. II and III only
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
If the list is sorted in reverse order, each pass through the array will involve the maximum possible number of comparisons and the maximum possible number of element movements if an insertion sort is used.

Question: 210
3.  Consider a binary search algorithm to search an ordered list of numbers. Which of the following choices is closest to the maximum number of times that such an algorithm will execute its main comparison loop when searching a list of 1 million numbers?
A. 6  B. 20  C. 100  D. 120  E. 1000
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
1 million = 10<sup>6</sup> = (10<sup>3</sup>)<sup>2</sup> â (2<sup>10</sup>)<sup>2</sup> = 2<sup>20</sup>. Thus, there will be on the order of 20 comparisons.

Question: 211
4.  Consider these three tasks.  I. A sequential search of an array of <i>n</i> names  II. A binary search of an array of <i>n</i> names in alphabetical order  III. An insertion sort into alphabetical order of an array of <i>n</i> names that are initially in random order  For large <i>n</i>, which of the following lists these tasks in order (from least to greatest) of their average case run times?
A. II I III  B. I II III  C. II III I  D. III I II  E. III II I
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
A binary search, on average, has a smaller run time than a sequential search. All of the sorting algorithms have greater run times than a sequential search. This is because a sequential search looks at each element once. A sorting algorithm, however, processes <i>other</i> elements in the array for each element it looks at.

Question: 212
5.  Suppose the game is programmed so that the computer uses a binary search strategy for making its guesses. What is the maximum number of guesses the computer could make before guessing the userâs number?
A. 50  B. 25  C. 10  D. 7  E. 6
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
The computer should find the number in no more than seven tries. This is because the guessing interval is halved on each successive try:  <div class="table-responsive"><table class="table table-bordered"><tr><td> (1) </td><td>  100 Ã· 2 = 50 numbers left to try </td></tr><tr><td> (2) </td><td> 50 Ã· 2 = 25 numbers left to try </td></tr><tr><td> (3) </td><td> 25 Ã· 2 = 13 numbers left to try </td></tr><tr><td> (4) </td><td> 13 Ã· 2 = 7 numbers left to try </td></tr><tr><td> (5) </td><td> 7 Ã· 2 = 4 numbers left to try </td></tr><tr><td> (6) </td><td> 4 Ã· 2 = 2 numbers left to try </td></tr><tr><td> (7) </td><td> 2 Ã· 2 = 1 number left to try </td></tr></table>  Seven iterations of the loop leaves just 1 number left to try! Donât forget the shortcut. The algorithm is a binary search of 100 possible elements. Rounding 100 up to the next power of 2 gives 128 = 2<sup>7</sup>. The exponent, 7, is the number of guesses in the worst case.
#########################################################
Question: 213
6.  Suppose the computer used a <i>sequential search</i> strategy for guessing the userâs number. What is the maximum number of guesses the computer could make before guessing the userâs number?
A. 100  B. 99  C. 50  D. 25  E. 10
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
The maximum number of guesses is 99. A sequential search means that the computer starts at the first possible numberânamely, 1âand tries each successive number until it gets to 99. If the userâs number is 100, the computer will know that when it tests 99.
#########################################################
Question: 214
7.  Using a sequential search strategy, how many guesses <i>on average</i> would the computer need to guess the number?
A. 100  B. Between 51 and 99  C. 50  D. 25  E. Fewer than 25
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
On average the computer will make 50 guesses. The user is equally likely to pick any number between 1 and 100. Half the time it will be less than 50; half the time, greater than 50. So on the average, the distance of the number from 1 is 50.

1.  Consider the following two methods in the same class.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/qno01_01.png"/>  If the current state of  <span class="text-monospace">mat</span> is <pre>        1 2 3 4 <br/>        5 6 7 8 </pre> which matrix will result from the method call  <span class="text-monospace">changeMatrix(mat);</span> ?
A. <pre>1 2 3 4<br/>5 6 7 8 </pre>  B. <pre>2 3 4 1<br/>6 7 8 5 </pre>  C. <pre>4 1 2 3<br/>8 5 6 7 </pre>  D. <pre>3 1 2 3<br/>7 5 6 7 </pre>  E. <pre>2 3 4 2<br/>6 7 8 6 </pre>
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Answer: E   The <span class="text-monospace">changeArray</span> method shifts the elements of its array parameter (except for <span class="text-monospace">a[0]</span>, which gets overwritten) one slot to the left. Then it sets <span class="text-monospace">a[a.length-1]</span>, the rightmost element, to the current value of <span class="text-monospace">a[0]</span>. The <span class="text-monospace">changeMatrix</span> method changes each of its rows in this way. Note that <span class="text-monospace">mat[0]</span>, <span class="text-monospace">mat[1]</span>, . . ., <span class="text-monospace">mat[mat.length-1]</span> are the row arrays of <span class="text-monospace">mat</span>.

Question: 216
2.  The Richter scale is used to measure the strength of an earthquake. A value on the scale is a real number between 0 and 10; and each step in the scaleâfor example from 5.0 to 6.0ârepresents a tenfold increase in the strength of the earthquake.  Consider the following class, written by a student, whose intent is to describe the effects of an earthquake.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/qno02_01.png"/>  Consider the following segment of a client program.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/brn_0002_mod.png"/>  If theÂ Richter magnitudeÂ is 4.0, what will be output?
A. <span class="text-monospace">Earth shakes. No destruction.</span>  B. <span class="text-monospace">Poorly-constructed buildings collapse.</span>  C. <span class="text-monospace">Barely felt by people.</span>  D. <span class="text-monospace">Earth shakes. No destruction.Barely felt by people.</span>  E. An error message will be output.
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Answer: C   The intent of the programmer is to set <span class="text-monospace">str</span> to  <span class="text-monospace">Earth shakes. No destruction.</span>  However, because <span class="text-monospace">else</span> is not used, each of the <span class="text-monospace">if</span> statements will be executed, and <span class="text-monospace">str</span> will be set twice, once when it passes the <span class="text-monospace">if (richter &gt;= 3.0)</span> test and again when it passes the <span class="text-monospace">if (richter &gt;= 0)</span> test. The programmer can avoid this either by using a sequence of <span class="text-monospace">else if</span> tests, thus excluding all other tests when one is found to be true, or by returning the appropriate string (with a <span class="text-monospace">return</span> statement) as soon as a test is true.

Question: 217
3.  Suppose  <span class="text-monospace">x</span>,  <span class="text-monospace">y</span>, and  <span class="text-monospace">z</span> are variables of type  <span class="text-monospace">int</span>. Consider the following boolean conditions.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/3.1.png"/>  Which of these expressions is true for all values of <span class="text-monospace">z</span><i>,</i> given that <span class="text-monospace">x</span> and <span class="text-monospace">y</span> have the same value?
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. II and III only
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Answer: E   For expression I to be true, each of the three tests must be true. Because the values of <span class="text-monospace">(y == z)</span> and <span class="text-monospace">(x == z)</span> are unknown, the truth value of expression I is unknown. Expression II is true if <span class="text-monospace">(x == y)</span> is true: Since <span class="text-monospace">&amp;&amp;</span> (and) has higher precedence than <span class="text-monospace">||</span> (or), you can think of expression II as being <span class="text-monospace">(x == y)</span> OR <i>p</i>, where <i>p</i> is the truth value of <span class="text-monospace">(y == z) &amp;&amp; (x == z)</span>. Given that <span class="text-monospace">(x == y)</span> is true, true OR <i>p</i> must be true, irrespective of whether <i>p</i> is true or false. Expression III is true, since <span class="text-monospace">x - y</span> equals 0, and 0 multiplied by any number of factors equals 0.

You may assume that each of the classes shown has a default constructor. <ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman">  <span class="text-monospace">LibraryItem item = new LibraryItem();</span>   <span class="text-monospace">Book b = new LibraryItem();</span>   <span class="text-monospace">LibraryItem cd = new CD();</span>  </ol>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. II and III only
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Answer: B   Declaration II fails because it fails this test:  <span class="text-monospace">LibraryItem <i>is-a</i> Book</span>? No.  Notice that declarations I and II pass the <i>is-a</i> test:  <span class="text-monospace">   LibraryItem <i>is-a</i> LibraryItem?</span> Yes.<br/> <span class="text-monospace">   CD <i>is-a</i> LibraryItem</span>?

5.  Suppose that, of the three classes shown in the diagram, only the  <span class="text-monospace">LibraryItem</span> class has a method called  <span class="text-monospace">getPrice</span> defined in it, whose specification is as follows.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/brn_0004_1_mod.png"> </img>  Now consider the following declaration that appears in a client program.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/brn_0004_2_mod.png"/>   Assume that  <span class="text-monospace">libraryList</span> is initialized with  <span class="text-monospace">LibraryItem</span> objects. Consider the following code segment that computes the total cost of all items stored in  <span class="text-monospace">libraryList</span>.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/brn_0004_mod2.png"/>   The use of  <span class="text-monospace">getPrice</span> in this code segment is an example of
A. an inherited method.  B. an overridden method.  C. polymorphism.  D. an overloaded method.  E. a mutator method.
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
Answer: A   Because the <span class="text-monospace">CD</span> and <span class="text-monospace">Book</span> classes are subclasses of <span class="text-monospace">LibraryItem</span>, each inherits <span class="text-monospace">getPrice</span> and can call it in a client class. Each of the other choices has a specific function, none of which is illustrated in the code segment. An overridden method is redefined in a subclass. (This is not true here, because you are given that <span class="text-monospace">getPrice</span> is defined only in the superclass.) Polymorphism operates only when methods are overridden: At run time, the actual subclass instance is bound to the correct version of the method. An overloaded method has the same name as another method in the class or subclass but a difference signature. A mutator method is one that changes the state of an object. The <span class="text-monospace">getPrice</span> method is an <span class="text-monospace">accessor</span>.

Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Answer: B   When i  is 0,  <span class="text-monospace">num</span> becomes 1, and <span class="text-monospace">arr</span> [0] is set to 1.

Question: 221
7.  A charity organization has a large list of donor records, sorted alphabetically by name. Each record contains the amount of money donated in the current year. Which of the following represents an algorithm that will locate the top seven donors for the current year?
A. Seven passes through the outer loop of an insertion sort  B. Seven passes through the outer loop of a selection sort  C. Seven recursive calls to mergesort  D. Seven passes through the loop of a binary search  E. Accessing the last seven entries in the list
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Answer: B    After seven passes of a selection sort, if you are sorting donors from largest to smallest amounts of money, the donors with the seven largest amounts will be in their final sorted position. Choice A doesn’t work because after seven passes through an insertion sort loop, the first seven elements will be sorted with respect to each other, but not in their <i>final</i> position. Choice C is completely wrong: Mergesort does not sort the elements into their final position until the final merging of elements. Choice D does not make sense: A binary search is meaningless if the array is not sorted by dollar amounts! Choice E will locate the seven donors whose names are at the end of the alphabetical list. They are not necessarily the people who donated the most money.

Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Answer: E   The <span class="text-monospace">value</span> must lie outside of the range, namely it must either be less than <span class="text-monospace">low</span> or greater than <span class="text-monospace">high</span>. Choices A and B are wrong, primarily because they are not valid Java expressions. Choice C returns true if <span class="text-monospace">value</span> is between <span class="text-monospace">low</span> and <span class="text-monospace">high</span>, which was not required. Choice D fails because it doesn't make sense to use AND here: How can <span class="text-monospace">value</span> be both less than <span class="text-monospace">low</span> and greater than <span class="text-monospace">high</span>?

A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. II and III only  E. I, II, and III

Explanation:
Answer: D   Segment I is incorrect because it assigns an <span class="text-monospace">int</span> to <span class="text-monospace">arr[0]</span>, instead of a <span class="text-monospace">Card</span>. Segments II and III correctly use the <span class="text-monospace">setValue</span> mutator to change the value. Segment III works because <span class="text-monospace">c</span> is a reference to <span class="text-monospace">arr[0]</span>, so changing <span class="text-monospace">c</span> changes the array.

Question: 224
10.  Consider the following class definitions.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/comp_prin_2f.png"/>  A client program has the following declarations.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/brn_0009_2_mod.png"/>  Which of the following statements is (are) valid?  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/10.3.png"/>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. II and III only  E. I and III only
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Answer: E   Statement I works because <span class="text-monospace">BalletDancer</span> inherits the <span class="text-monospace">leap</span> method. Statement III works because <span class="text-monospace">Dancer</span> contains the <span class="text-monospace">leap</span> method. Statement II fails because <span class="text-monospace">Dancer</span> does not contain a <span class="text-monospace">glide</span> method. There will be a compile-time error. The statement can be fixed with a cast:  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/10.4.png"/>

Question: 225
1.  The  <span class="text-monospace">flip</span> method below simulates a flip of a weighted coin by returning "heads" or "tails"Â each time it is called. The coin is three times more likely to turn up heads than tails.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/brn_0010_1_mod.png"/>  Which of the following is correct  <span class="text-monospace">/*</span> <span class="text-monospace"> <i>implementation code</i> </span> <span class="text-monospace">*/</span>?  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/comp_prin_2h.png"/>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Answer: E   All work! In implementation III, <span class="text-monospace">x</span> is a real number that lies in the interval 0.0 â¤ <span class="text-monospace">x</span> &lt; 1.0. The interval 0.0 â¤ <span class="text-monospace">x</span> &lt; 0.75 is three times as long as 0.75 â¤ <span class="text-monospace">x</span> &lt; 1.0, thus the test <span class="text-monospace">if(x &lt; 0.75)</span> is correct. In implementation II, <span class="text-monospace">r</span> has value <span class="text-monospace">0</span>, <span class="text-monospace">1</span>, <span class="text-monospace">2</span>, or <span class="text-monospace">3</span>, with equal probability. Thus the test returns <span class="text-monospace">"heads"</span> if <span class="text-monospace">r</span> is <span class="text-monospace">0</span>, <span class="text-monospace">1</span>, or <span class="text-monospace">2</span>, an outcome that is three times as likely as <span class="text-monospace">r</span> being <span class="text-monospace">3</span>. Implementation I works similarly, with 100 possible random integers. For 3/4 of these, the method returns <span class="text-monospace">"heads,"</span> and for 1/4, it returns <span class="text-monospace">"tails."</span>

The sum of all odd values in  <span class="text-monospace">arr</span>  D. The sum of all positive values and odd negative values in  <span class="text-monospace">arr</span>  E. The sum of all positive values and even negative values in  <span class="text-monospace">arr</span>
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
Answer: D   The test  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/qn12_03.png"/>  translates to "if <span class="text-monospace">num</span> is positive or the absolute value of <span class="text-monospace">num</span> is odd . . . ."

The sum of all even values in  <span class="text-monospace">arr</span>  D. The sum of all negative values and positive even values in  <span class="text-monospace">arr</span>  E. The sum of all values in  <span class="text-monospace">arr</span>
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Answer: B   The test  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/qn13_01.png"/>  translates to "if <span class="text-monospace">num</span> is negative and the absolute value of <span class="text-monospace">num</span> is even . . . ." Because both conditions must be true for the value to be added, <span class="text-monospace">sum2</span> will include all negative values in <span class="text-monospace">arr</span> that are also even.

Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Answer: E    There are six different possible values for <span class="text-monospace">x1</span> and <span class="text-monospace">x2</span>:  10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15.   Thus <span class="text-monospace">Math.random()</span> must be multiplied by 6. Eliminate choices B and D, which multiply by 5. Choices A and C are wrong because <span class="text-monospace">x1</span> and <span class="text-monospace">x2</span> may be the same value. Choice E correctly reassigns <span class="text-monospace">x2</span> until it has a different value from <span class="text-monospace">x1</span>.

6.  What will be output for  <span class="text-monospace">str1</span> by a call to  <span class="text-monospace">mystery</span>?
A. <span class="text-monospace">dogcatcowbird</span>  B. <span class="text-monospace">ogatowird</span>  C. <span class="text-monospace">oaoi</span>  D. <span class="text-monospace">dccb</span>  E. <span class="text-monospace">og</span>
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Answer: B   The <span class="text-monospace">substring</span> method, when used with just one parameter, returns the substring of the calling string that starts at the parameter position and extends to the end of the string. Thus, <span class="text-monospace">"dog".substring(1)</span> will return <span class="text-monospace">og</span>. The enhanced <span class="text-monospace">for</span> loop in method <span class="text-monospace">mystery</span> cycles through each string in <span class="text-monospace">list</span> and appends the relevant substring of the current element to <span class="text-monospace">str1</span>: <span class="text-monospace">og</span> + <span class="text-monospace">at</span> + <span class="text-monospace">ow</span> + <span class="text-monospace">ird</span>, resulting in choice B.

Question: 231
7.  What will be output for  <span class="text-monospace">str2</span> by a call to  <span class="text-monospace">mystery</span>?
A. <span class="text-monospace">oaoi</span>  B. <span class="text-monospace">dccb</span>  C. <span class="text-monospace">gtwr</span>  D. <span class="text-monospace">ogatowir</span>  E. <span class="text-monospace">docacobi</span>
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
Answer: A   When the <span class="text-monospace">substring</span> method is used with two parameters, the first parameter is where the substring starts, and the second parameter is the position one place to the right of where the substring ends. <span class="text-monospace">"bird".substring(1, 2)</span> will return <span class="text-monospace">i</span>, for example. The enhanced for loop in method <span class="text-monospace">mystery</span> thus appends to <span class="text-monospace">str2</span> a single-character string for each element in <span class="text-monospace">list</span>: <span class="text-monospace">o</span> + <span class="text-monospace">a</span> + <span class="text-monospace">o</span> + <span class="text-monospace">i</span>, resulting in choice A.

Consider the following declarations.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/brn_0015_mod_2.png"/>  Which of the following code segments will correctly add all the elements of <span class="text-monospace">arr</span> to <span class="text-monospace">list</span>? (The final ordering of <span class="text-monospace">list</span> elements is irrelevant.) <ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman">   <span class="text-monospace">for (int i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++)<br/> Â  Â  Â list.add(arr[i]);</span>   <span class="text-monospace">for (int i = arr.length - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--)<br/> Â  Â  Â list.add(arr[i]);</span>   <span class="text-monospace">for (int i = arr.length - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--)<br/> Â  Â  Â list.add(i, arr[i]);</span>  </ol>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
Answer: D   Segment III fails because the index for <span class="text-monospace">list</span> is out of range. For example, if the array has 8 elements, the algorithm in segment III will try to add an element to an empty list at position 7. This will throw an <span class="text-monospace">IndexOutOfBoundsException</span>.

9.  Which of the following declarations in a client class would cause an error?   <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/19.1.png"> </img>
A. I only  B. II only  C. I and II only  D. II and III only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Answer: E   None of these declarations will get past the compiler. Declaration I fails because the <span class="text-monospace">PosInt</span> class has no default constructor. Declaration II fails for the same reason: If <span class="text-monospace">PosInt</span> had a default constructor, the following code would automatically be placed in the subclass <span class="text-monospace">EvenPosInt</span>.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/brn_0016_1_mod.png"/>  Declaration III fails because the superclass constructors are not inherited. You need to add the following constructor code to <span class="text-monospace">EvenPosInt</span> to make declaration III work.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/brn_0016_2_mod.png"/>  But this only works if there is a default constructor in the superclass!

A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. II and III only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Answer: B   Implementation I is incorrect because a subclass cannot access the private data of its superclass. The accessor method <span class="text-monospace">getValue</span> must be used (shown in implementation II). Implementation III is wrong because <span class="text-monospace">this</span> represents the current <span class="text-monospace">EvenPosInt</span> object, not its value. The statement can be corrected to:  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/brn_0016_3_mod.png"/>  Note that without a constructor an <span class="text-monospace">EvenPosInt</span> could not be created.

A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. II and III only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Answer: B   In an enhanced <span class="text-monospace">for</span> loop (i.e., for-each loop) indices are not explicitly accessed by the programmer. Thus, segments I and III are wrong.

2.  Consider the following method.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/qno22_01.png"/>  What will be returned by a call to  <span class="text-monospace">multiply(8)</span>?
A. 1  B. 8  C. a value equal to (8)(7)(6)(5)(4)(3)(2)  D. a value equal to (8)(6)(4)(2)  E. a value equal to (7)(5)(3)
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
Answer: D   Since <span class="text-monospace">n == 8</span> fails the two base case tests, method <span class="text-monospace">multiply</span> returns values as follows:  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/brn_0018_mod.png"/>  This is equivalent to (8)(6)(4)(2).

A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and III only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
Answer: D   Because the <span class="text-monospace">String</span> class has an <span class="text-monospace">equals</span> method, and strings <span class="text-monospace">s1</span> and <span class="text-monospace">s2</span> have the same contents, test I will be true. Since <span class="text-monospace">String</span> has a <span class="text-monospace">compareTo</span> method, test III, the test for equality, will be true. Test II returns false because the <span class="text-monospace">==</span> operator tests whether two object <i>references</i> are the same. Since <span class="text-monospace">s1</span> and <span class="text-monospace">s2</span> were each created with <span class="text-monospace">new</span>, the references are different. Note that if the declarations had been  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/brn_0019_2_mod.png"/>  then <span class="text-monospace">s1 == s2</span> would be true.

Neither <span class="text-monospace">/*  <i>statement 1</i>  */</span> nor  <span class="text-monospace">/*  <i>statement 2</i>  */</span> will be executed. Execution will pass to  <span class="text-monospace">/*  <i>statement 3</i>  */</span>.  D. A compile-time error will occur.  E. An exception will be thrown.
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
Answer: A   If <span class="text-monospace">a == b</span> is true, then <span class="text-monospace">a != b</span> is false, and the entire compound <span class="text-monospace">if</span> test will be false, leading to the evaluation of <span class="text-monospace">/*  <i>statement 2</i>  */</span>. Short-circuiting will occur as soon as <span class="text-monospace">a != b</span> is evaluated. This means that <span class="text-monospace">n / (a - b) &gt; 90</span> will never be evaluated. Notice that <span class="text-monospace">n / (a - b)</span> represents division by 0, so if the second piece of the test <i>were</i> evaluated, it would cause an <span class="text-monospace">ArithmeticException</span> to be thrown. If the test executes without error, <span class="text-monospace"><i> /* statement 3 */ </i></span> will always be executed, because it is outside the <span class="text-monospace">if...else</span> statement.

Explanation:
Answer: A   The algorithm traverses the matrix starting with the second row ( <span class="text-monospace">i=1</span>) and second column ( <span class="text-monospace">j=1</span>). The expressions <span class="text-monospace">i+=2</span> and <span class="text-monospace">j+=2</span> cause every other row and column to be skipped.

A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. II and III only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
Answer: D   Suppose the <span class="text-monospace">NumberDisplay</span> represents hours on a 24-hour digital clock. The roll over limit will be 24, and the values will range from 0 to 23 inclusive. Thus, <span class="text-monospace">value</span> can never equal <span class="text-monospace">rollOverLimit</span> at the start of the method. Therefore, segment I fails. Segment II performs the operations in the correct order: Add 1 to the value; check if the limit has been reached; and, if so, reset the value to 0. Segment III achieves the correct result in a tricky way. Suppose <span class="text-monospace">value</span> is 9. Then <span class="text-monospace">value</span> = (10) % 24 = 10, which was required. Suppose <span class="text-monospace">value</span> is 23. Then <span class="text-monospace">value</span> = (24) % 24 = 0, which is correct.

Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
Answer: D   The relationship between a <span class="text-monospace">DigitalClock</span> and <span class="text-monospace">NumberDisplay</span> is a <i>has-a</i> relationship: The <span class="text-monospace">DigitalClock </span> <i>has-a </i> <span class="text-monospace">NumberDisplay</span> for hours, and it <i>has-a </i> <span class="text-monospace">NumberDisplay</span> for minutes. There is no inheritance in this relationship, so all of the choices that use "extends" in their class headers are wrong (choices A, B, and C). Choice E is wrong because <span class="text-monospace">hours</span> and <span class="text-monospace">minutes</span> should be of type <span class="text-monospace">NumberDisplay</span>.

Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
Answer: A   Each of the references, <span class="text-monospace">objA</span>, <span class="text-monospace">objB</span>, and <span class="text-monospace">objC</span>, has access to <span class="text-monospace">doSomething</span>. So the only issue in this question is the parameter types. According to the <span class="text-monospace">doSomething</span> method header, the first parameter must pass the <i>is-a</i> <span class="text-monospace"> ClassB</span> test, and the second parameter must pass the <i>is-a</i> <span class="text-monospace"> ClassC</span> test. Choice A is the only choice in which both parameters satisfy this requirement.

Refer to the static method  <span class="text-monospace">removeValue</span>.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/comp_prin_2q.png"/>  Which represents an  <span class="text-monospace">/*  <i>implementation</i>  */</span> of  <span class="text-monospace">removeValue</span> that achieves the postcondition?  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/brn_0024_mod.png"/> <pre></pre>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and III only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Answer: C   Segment I will not work whenever there are consecutive occurrences of <span class="text-monospace">value</span>. This is because removal of an element from <span class="text-monospace">list</span> causes the elements to the right of it to be shifted to the left to fill the "hole." The index <span class="text-monospace">i</span>, however, moves one slot to the right. For example, if <span class="text-monospace">list</span> contains 1, 6, 6, 9, and 6 is the value to be removed, <span class="text-monospace">list</span> will end up with 1, 6, 9. (The first occurrence of 6 will be removed. The second occurrence will be passed over.) Segment III, a correct algorithm, works because the index shifts right only if an element was not equal to <span class="text-monospace">value</span>. You should reject segment II as soon as you see it. An enhanced <span class="text-monospace">for</span> loop should not be used to remove elements from a list.

Question: 244
10.  Suppose methods  <span class="text-monospace">f1</span> and  <span class="text-monospace">f2</span> are defined as follows.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/brn_0025_1_mod.png"/>  What value is returned as a result of the call  <span class="text-monospace">f1(5)</span>?
A. -4  B. 4  C. 6  D. 8  E. Infinite recursion occurs, and no value is returned.
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Answer: C   The method call <span class="text-monospace">f1(5)</span> leads to the following sequence of calls.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/brn_0025_2_mod.png"/>

Question: 245
1.  Which is correct  <span class="text-monospace">/*  <i>implementation</i>  */</span> code for the constructor of the  <span class="text-monospace">Hen</span> class?  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/31.1.png"> </img>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. II and III only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Answer: B   The superclass, <span class="text-monospace">Bird</span>, does not have a default constructor; therefore, segment I is incorrect. Segment II works because the constructor for <span class="text-monospace">Bird</span> has one <span class="text-monospace">String</span> parameter. Segment III fails because a subclass cannot access the private data of its superclass.

Question: 246
2.  A client class has an  <span class="text-monospace">ArrayList&lt;Bird&gt; birds</span> that is initialized with many different objects that are subclasses of  <span class="text-monospace">Bird</span>. Each subclass has an overridden  <span class="text-monospace">makeNoise</span> method, similar to those shown in the  <span class="text-monospace">Owl</span> and  <span class="text-monospace">Hen</span> classes. What is the effect of executing the following code segment?  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/brn_0026_mod.png"> </img>
A. The unique noise for each particular  <span class="text-monospace">Bird</span> will be output.  B. There will be a compile-time error with a message to the effect that there cannot  be different types in  <span class="text-monospace">ArrayList&lt;Bird&gt;</span>.  C. There will be a compile-time error with a message to the effect that  <span class="text-monospace">Bird b</span> needs to be cast to its actual type.  D. An  <span class="text-monospace">IndexOutOfBoundsException</span> will be thrown.  E. A <span class="text-monospace">ConcurrentModificationException</span> will be thrown.
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
Answer: A   The code will work as intended, namely, at run time, the appropriate <span class="text-monospace">makeNoise</span> method will be called, depending on the current instance of <span class="text-monospace">Bird b</span>. This is an example of polymorphism or dynamic binding. Polymorphism occurs when a superclass method has been overridden in the subclass(es). Choices B and C are incorrect because they contradict polymorphism. Choice D is false because no indices are accessed in the code. Choice E is false because no attempt is made to add an element to <span class="text-monospace">birds</span> in the enhanced <span class="text-monospace">for</span> loop.

Question: 248
4.  An array of hospital records is sorted by patient ID numbers. Suppose a patient's record must be located given the patient's name only. Which of the following procedures is the most efficient for locating that patient's record?
A. Do a binary search.  B. Do a sequential search.  C. Sort the array into alphabetical order, then do a binary search.  D. Sort the array into alphabetical order, then do a sequential search.  E. Start with the first record and examine every fifth record. If this fails, start with the second record and examine every fourth record. If this fails, start with the third record and examine every third record. Proceed in this way until the record with the given name is found.
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Answer: B   The records are not ordered by name, so the quickest way to find the given record is to start at the first record and proceed sequentially through the records until you find the given name. Eliminate choice A: You can't do a binary search for a given name unless the array is sorted by <i>name</i>. Choices C and D will eventually locate the given record, but it is inefficient to start by sorting the array. Since sorting requires the examination of every record anyway, you may as well omit the sort and start with the sequential search! The fancy algorithm in choice E doesn't save time. It, in fact, examines some records more than once!

Question: 249
5.  Which of the following is (are) false?  <ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman">  A subclass inherits all the constructors of its superclass.   A subclass inherits all the private instance variables of its superclass.   A subclass inherits all the methods of its superclass.  </ol>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Answer: E    <p data-uid="">Constructors are never inherited, nor are private instance variables. To access the private data of its superclass, a subclass must use the inherited accessor methods of the superclass. Statement III is false because a subclass does not inherit the private methods of its superclass.

6.  Consider the method  <span class="text-monospace">makeBorder</span>, whose intent is to place a border of  <span class="text-monospace">num</span> around matrix  <span class="text-monospace">mat</span>.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/brn_0030_mod.png"/>  For example, if  <span class="text-monospace">mat</span> is originally  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/36.2.png"/>  the method call  <span class="text-monospace">makeBorder(mat, 9)</span> will change  <span class="text-monospace">mat</span> to be  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/36.3.png"/>  If  <span class="text-monospace">mat</span> is originally  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/36.4.png"/>  the method call  <span class="text-monospace">makeBorder(mat, 2)</span> will change  <span class="text-monospace">mat</span> to be  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/36.5.png"/>  Which of the replacements for  <span class="text-monospace">/* code to make border of num */</span> will work as intended?  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/brn_0030_2_mod.png"/> <pre></pre>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Answer: E   All work! Segment I traverses the whole matrix and changes only those elements that are in the top or bottom rows of the leftmost or rightmost columns. Segment II changes first the leftmost and rightmost columns, then the top and bottom rows. Segment III does the same as segment II, except it doesn't change the corner elements, which have already been changed by the first <span class="text-monospace">for</span> loop.

7.  In a client program, which of the following correctly declares and initializes  <span class="text-monospace">Employee emp</span> whose name is Ben M. Zax and ID number is 1492?  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/brn_0031_2_mod.png"> </img> <pre></pre>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. II and III only
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Answer: C   The <span class="text-monospace">Employee</span> constructor takes two parameters, one of type <span class="text-monospace">Name</span> and one of type <span class="text-monospace">int</span>. Declaration III has the correct types. Declaration II does not: The first parameter is a <span class="text-monospace">String</span>, not a <span class="text-monospace">Name</span>. Declaration I has two problems: It uses a default constructor even though <span class="text-monospace">Employee</span> does not necessarily have one. It also attempts to access the private instance variables of the <span class="text-monospace">Employee</span> class, which is illegal for a client class.
#########################################################
Question: 252
8.  Of the following, which is the most appropriate header in a static client class for a  <span class="text-monospace">nameMatch</span> method that determines whether two  <span class="text-monospace">Employee</span>s have the same name?
A. <span class="text-monospace">public static boolean nameMatch(Employee other)</span>  B. <span class="text-monospace">public static void nameMatch(Employee other)</span>  C. <span class="text-monospace">public static boolean nameMatch(Name other)</span>  D. <span class="text-monospace">public static void nameMatch(Employee emp1, Employee emp2)</span>  E. <span class="text-monospace">public static boolean nameMatch(Employee emp1, Employee emp2)</span>
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Answer: E   This is an objectless client method, so there is no current <span class="text-monospace">Employee</span> object. This means that the method needs two <span class="text-monospace">Employee</span> parameters to compare. You can therefore eliminate choices A, B, and C. Note that the method should return true if the <span class="text-monospace">Employee</span> parameters have the same name, false otherwise. Therefore, the method should have a <span class="text-monospace">boolean</span> return type, and you can eliminate choice D.

Question: 253
9.  The following method is intended to return the index of the "smallest" word in the array <span class="text-monospace">words</span>, namely the word that would appear first in an alphabetized list of the strings in the array.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/brn_0032_mod.png"/>  Which of the following should be used to replace  <span class="text-monospace">/* condition */</span> so that  <span class="text-monospace">findMin</span> works as intended?
A. <span class="text-monospace">words[minPos] &gt; words[index]</span>  B. <span class="text-monospace">words[index] &gt; words[minPos]</span>  C. <span class="text-monospace">words[index].compareTo(words[minPos]) &gt; 0</span>  D. <span class="text-monospace">words[index].compareTo(words[minPos]) &gt;= 0</span>  E. <span class="text-monospace">words[index].compareTo(words[minPos]) &lt; 0</span>
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Answer: E   Eliminate choices A and B: When comparing <span class="text-monospace">String</span> objects, you cannot use simple inequality operators; you <i>must</i> use <span class="text-monospace">compareTo</span>. For the calling object to be <i>less than</i> the parameter object, use the <i>less than</i> 0 test (a good way to remember this!).

Question: 254
10.  Consider the following static method,  <span class="text-monospace">countDiff</span>. Method  <span class="text-monospace">countDiff</span> is intended to count the number of different values in array  <span class="text-monospace">arr</span>. It does not, however, work as intended. (Lines are numbered for reference.)  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/40.1.png"/>  Which of the following changes should be made so that  <span class="text-monospace">countDiff</span> will work as intended?
A. <span class="cambria">Line 8 should be changed to</span> <span class="text-monospace">int count = 0;</span>  B. <span class="cambria">Line 9 should be changed to</span> <span class="text-monospace">for (int i = 0; i &lt; arr.length - 1; i++)</span>  C. <span class="cambria">Line 11 should be changed to</span> <span class="text-monospace">if (arr[i] == arr[i + 1])</span>  D. <span class="cambria">Line 16 should be changed to</span> <span class="text-monospace">return arr.length - count;</span>  E. <span class="cambria">Line 16 should be changed to</span> <span class="text-monospace">return count - arr.length;</span>
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Answer: B   In the given implementation of the method, <span class="text-monospace">count</span> is incremented every time a different value is encountered, which is what was required. The problem in the code is that if line 9 is not changed, when the last index in the array is reached, <span class="text-monospace">arr[i + 1]</span> is out of range and an exception will be thrown ( <span class="text-monospace">ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</span>). Assuming that line 9 is fixed, each of the other choices will cause an intent error. Choice A will return a count that is off by one. Choice C will increment the count when two adjacent values are the same, which is not what was required. Choice D will give a count of each occurrence of a duplicate value-not required. Choice E will give zero or a negative value, which doesn't make sense.

1.  Refer to the following code segment.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg65_01.png"/>  In terms of  <span class="text-monospace">n</span>, which is nearest to the number of times <span class="text-monospace">process (i)</span> will be executed?
A. 1  B. <span class="text-monospace">n</span>  C. <span class="text-monospace">n</span><sup>2</sup>  D. <span class="text-monospace">n</span>/2  E. <span class="text-monospace">k</span>, where <span class="text-monospace">n = 2<sup>k</sup></span>
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Answer: E    The <span class="text-monospace">for</span> loop is executed approximately log<sub>2</sub> <span class="text-monospace">n</span> times (i.e., the number of times that <span class="text-monospace">i</span>, which is initialized to <span class="text-monospace">n</span>, is divided by 2 until it reaches 1). If you take a small value for <span class="text-monospace">n</span>, like 16, you can very quickly eliminate choices A-D.

2.  Consider the following hierarchy of classes. Each of the classes has a default constructor.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/t2_s1_002.png"/>  Which of the following is (are) true? <ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman">  If <span class="text-monospace">EnglishTeacher</span> has no overridden methods,  <span class="text-monospace">PoetryTeacher</span> inherits all the public methods of  <span class="text-monospace">Teacher</span> and  <span class="text-monospace">EnglishTeacher</span>.    <span class="text-monospace">MathTeacher</span> inherits the constructors of  <span class="text-monospace">Teacher</span>.    <span class="text-monospace">PoetryTeacher</span> inherits the constructors of  <span class="text-monospace">EnglishTeacher</span> and  <span class="text-monospace">Teacher</span>.  </ol>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
Answer: A   Statement I is true: Since <span class="text-monospace">EnglishTeacher</span> is a subclass of <span class="text-monospace">Teacher</span>, it inherits all public methods of <span class="text-monospace">Teacher</span>, and since <span class="text-monospace">PoetryTeacher</span> is a subclass of <span class="text-monospace">EnglishTeacher</span>, it inherits those methods too, plus any additional public methods in <span class="text-monospace">EnglishTeacher</span>. (Note that if <span class="text-monospace">EnglishTeacher</span> had an overridden method, then <span class="text-monospace">PoetryTeacher</span> would inherit that method, not the original method in <span class="text-monospace">Teacher</span>.) Statements II and III are wrong because constructors are not inherited.

Question: 257
3.  Consider the following hierarchy of classes. Each of the classes has a default constructor.  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/t2_s1_002.png"/>  A program is written to print data about teachers in a school.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg67_01.png"/>  Class <span class="text-monospace">SchoolStuff</span> has the following declarations.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/comp_prin_2w.png"/>  In the <span class="text-monospace">SchoolStuff</span> class, which of the following method calls will <i>not</i> cause an error?  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg67_03.png"/>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. II and III only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Answer: E   All are correct. The parameter must be a <span class="text-monospace">Teacher</span>, and each of <span class="text-monospace">t1</span>, <span class="text-monospace">t2</span>, and <span class="text-monospace">t3</span> satisfies that requirement.

Question: 258
4.  Which of the following correctly initializes a two-dimensional array  <span class="text-monospace">mat</span> of  <span class="text-monospace">int</span>, with  <span class="text-monospace">numRows</span> rows and  <span class="text-monospace">numCols</span> columns, so that it contains all zeroes?  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg68_01.png"/>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. II and III only
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
Answer: D    Segment I uses the fact that <span class="text-monospace">mat</span> is an array of rows in which each row is an array of <span class="text-monospace">int</span> with <span class="text-monospace">numCols</span> elements. Segment III fails because you can’t use an enhanced <span class="text-monospace">for</span> loop to assign elements in this way. Segment II is the traversal needed for assignment of elements.

5.  Look at the following poorly formatted program segment. If  <span class="text-monospace">a == 7</span> and  <span class="text-monospace">c == 6</span> before execution, which of the following represents the correct values of  <span class="text-monospace">c</span>,  <span class="text-monospace">d</span>,  <span class="text-monospace">p</span>, and  <span class="text-monospace">t</span> after execution?

Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
Answer: A   Because <span class="text-monospace">(a == 6)</span> is <span class="text-monospace">false</span>, the  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg69_02.png"/>  statement will not be executed. The second <span class="text-monospace">else</span> matches up with the first <span class="text-monospace">if</span>, which means that <span class="text-monospace">p = 9</span> gets executed.

Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Answer: B   The statement <span class="text-monospace">temp = s.substring(i, i+1)</span> places in <span class="text-monospace">temp</span> the string containing the character at position <span class="text-monospace">i</span>. The <span class="text-monospace">for</span> loop thus cycles through <span class="text-monospace">"conglomeration,"</span> starting at <span class="text-monospace">"c,"</span> and compares each single character string to <span class="text-monospace">"m."</span> If that character precedes <span class="text-monospace">"m,"</span> a new <span class="text-monospace">String</span> reference <span class="text-monospace">w</span> is created, which consists of the current value of <span class="text-monospace">w</span> concatenated with that character. Notice that every character in the string <span class="text-monospace">"cgleai"</span> precedes <span class="text-monospace">"m"</span> in alphabetical order.

7.  Which of the following code segments correctly stores in  <span class="text-monospace">x</span> a random real number such that 0.6 â¤  <span class="text-monospace">x</span> &lt; 1?
A. <span class="text-monospace">double x = 0.6 * Math.random() + 0.4;</span>  B. <span class="text-monospace">double x = 0.4 * Math.random() + 0.6;</span>  C. <span class="text-monospace">double x = Math.random() - 0.4;</span>  D. <span class="text-monospace">double x = (double) (Math.random() * 0.4);</span>  E. <span class="text-monospace">double x = (double) (Math.random() + 0.6);</span>
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Answer: B    The statement   <span class="text-monospace">   double x = Math.random();</span>   produces a random real number such that <span class="text-monospace">0 â¤ x &lt; 1</span>. The statement  <span class="text-monospace">   double x = 0.4 * Math.random();</span>   produces a random real in 0 â¤ <span class="text-monospace">x</span> &lt; 0.4. To shift this interval 0.6 to the right, you need   <span class="text-monospace">   double x = (0.4 * Math.random()) + 0.6;</span>

Question: 262
8.  Consider an array <span class="text-monospace">arr</span> that is initialized with integers, and an <span class="text-monospace">ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;</span> declared as follows.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg72_01.png"/>  Which of the following will add all the elements of <span class="text-monospace">arr</span> to <span class="text-monospace">list</span> without error? The final ordering of elements is irrelevant.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg72_02.png"/>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Answer: E   All are correct! In segment I, all elements of <span class="text-monospace">arr</span> are accessed and added to <span class="text-monospace">list</span>. Segments II and III must be careful to avoid an <span class="text-monospace">ArrayIndexOutOfBounds</span> index by not including <span class="text-monospace">arr[arr.length]</span>. Note that segment III accesses elements in reverse order, which is allowed.

Question: 263
9.  Consider array <span class="text-monospace">arr</span>, which is initialized as follows.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg73_01.png"/>  Which statement about a sequential search or binary search is <i>false</i>?
A. A key of 20 represents a worst case for sequential search.  B. A key of 8 represents a best case for binary search.  C. A key of 0 represents a worst case for sequential search.  D. A key of 20 represents a worst case for binary search.  E. A key of 30 represents a worst case for both sequential and binary searches.
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Answer: C    In a sequential search in a sorted array, a key that is less than the first element will be revealed almost immediately in the search, and so cannot be a worst case. Choice A is true because the search algorithm must search the whole array before 20 is found. Choice B is true because <span class="text-monospace">arr[(0 + 7)/2] = arr[3]</span> will be the first element compared to the key. Choice D is true because a rightmost endpoint is a worst case for binary search, whereas a leftmost endpoint would not be, because the div operation skews to the left. Choice E is true because an element that is to the right of the largest element of the array will need the maximum number of passes through the search algorithms (both binary and sequential) to discover that it’s not in the array.

Question: 264
10.  Which statement about constructors is <i>false</i>?
A. It is legal for the value of a static variable to be changed in a constructor.  B. The constructor in a subclass must use the keyword  <span class="text-monospace">super</span> to initialize the private instance variables from its superclass.  C. A subclass can have a default constructor that differs from the default constructor of its superclass.  D. A subclass has fewer constructors than its superclass.  E. If a subclass does not explicitly provide a constructor and its superclass has justone constructor with a parameter, an error will occur when an attempt is made to createan instance of a subclass object.
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
Answer: D   A subclass can have any number of constructors. Each of the other statements is true. For choice A, a static variable stores information for the entire class. For example, it could provide a new serial number each time an object is created. To do this, the variable must be updated in the constructor. For choice B, a subclass cannot directly access the private instance variables of its superclass. It therefore <i>must</i> use <span class="text-monospace">super</span> to invoke the constructor of the superclass to initialize those variables. For choice C, the default constructor of a subclass often initializes new private instance variables that are not in the superclass. For choice E, if there is no constructor in a subclass, code for a superclass default constructor will be provided by the compiler. If the superclass does not have a default constructor, there will be a compile-time error.

Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Answer: C   The outer loop produces five rows of output. Each pass through the inner loop goes from <span class="text-monospace">1</span> to <span class="text-monospace">i</span>, printing each value of <span class="text-monospace">k</span>. Thus, in the first row, when <span class="text-monospace">i</span> is <span class="text-monospace">5</span>, the numbers <span class="text-monospace">1 2 3 4 5</span> are printed. In the second row, the numbers <span class="text-monospace">1 2 3 4</span> are printed, and so on.

Which element will be in  <span class="text-monospace">numbers[0]</span> after execution of the  <span class="text-monospace">shuffleNumbers</span> method?
A. <span class="text-monospace">9</span>  B. <span class="text-monospace">8</span>  C. <span class="text-monospace">7</span>  D. <span class="text-monospace">6</span>  E. <span class="text-monospace">5</span>

Question: 267
3.  Which is a true statement about the methods in  <span class="text-monospace">ClassA</span> and  <span class="text-monospace">ClassB</span>?
A. <span class="text-monospace">ClassB</span> inherits  <span class="text-monospace">method2</span> from  <span class="text-monospace">ClassA</span>.  B. <span class="text-monospace">ClassA</span> inherits  <span class="text-monospace">method2</span> from  <span class="text-monospace">ClassB</span>.  C. <span class="text-monospace">method1</span> is an example of an overloaded method.  D. <span class="text-monospace">method2</span> is an example of an overridden method.  E. <span class="text-monospace">method1</span> is an example of an overridden method.
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Answer: E   An overridden method is an inherited method whose implementation is changed in the subclass (same header, different body). Since <span class="text-monospace">method1</span> fits this description, choice E is true and choice D is false. For choice A, <span class="text-monospace">method2</span> is defined for the first time in <span class="text-monospace">ClassB</span>. Therefore, it is not inherited. For choice B, a superclass <i>never</i> inherits a method from its subclass. For choice C, for <span class="text-monospace">method1</span> to be an overloaded method, it would need a different signature in <span class="text-monospace">ClassB</span>.

Consider the following declarations in a client class.   <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/brn_0050_1_mod.png"> </img>  Which of the following method calls will cause an error?   <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/brn_0050_2_mod.png"/>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. II and III only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
Answer: D   Statement I is okay. Either <span class="text-monospace">ob1</span> or <span class="text-monospace">ob2</span> could call <span class="text-monospace">method1</span> without a problem since each is of type <span class="text-monospace">ClassA</span> and <span class="text-monospace">method1</span> is in <span class="text-monospace">ClassA</span>. Statement II fails because an object of a superclass does not have access to new methods of its subclass. Statement III fails because <span class="text-monospace">ob2</span> is declared to be of type <span class="text-monospace">ClassA</span>, so a compile-time error will occur with a message indicating that there is no <span class="text-monospace">method2</span> in <span class="text-monospace">ClassA</span>.

Question: 269
5.  Consider the <span class="text-monospace">ElapsedTime</span> constructor that creates an <span class="text-monospace">ElapsedTime</span> object from its <span class="text-monospace">numSecs</span> parameter.  Recall that there are 60 seconds in a minute, and 60 minutes in an hour.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg79_01a.png"> </img>  Which of the following is a correct /* <span class="text-monospace">ElapsedTimeÂ  <i>implementation code</i>  */?</span>  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg79_02.png"/>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and III only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Answer: C   Implementation III is correct: The number of seconds equals the remainder when <span class="text-monospace">numSecs</span> is divided by 60; the number of minutes equals the quotient when <span class="text-monospace">numSecs</span> is divided by 60; and the number of hours equals the quotient when the number of minutes is divided by 60.  A constructor must assign values to the private instance variables, in a way that satisfies their specifications. Implementation I fails because it doesn’t assign values to <span class="text-monospace">hours</span> and <span class="text-monospace">mins</span>, and also because <span class="text-monospace">secs</span> should be no greater than 59. Implementation II fails on the assignment of <span class="text-monospace">secs</span>. For example, if <span class="text-monospace">numSecs</span> is 67, <span class="text-monospace">hours</span> is 0, <span class="text-monospace">mins</span> is 1, but <span class="text-monospace">secs</span> is not equal to 67 - (0 + 1).

A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. II and III only
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Answer: E   Implementation I uses faulty logic. For example, it treats an <span class="text-monospace">ElapsedTime</span> of 5 hours 12 minutes 30 seconds as equal to 12 hours 6 minutes 20 seconds.

A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. II and III only
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Answer: B   To assign elements to array <span class="text-monospace">arr</span>, the <span class="text-monospace">arr[i] =...</span> structure is needed. Therefore, segment I is wrong. Segment III would be correct if the last line were  <span class="text-monospace">   arr[i] = list.get(i);</span>

A. An <span class="text-monospace">ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</span> will be thrown because there is no check on the array indices in the <span class="text-monospace">for</span> loop.  B. A <span class="text-monospace">ConcurrentModificationException</span> will be thrown.  C. A  <span class="text-monospace">NullPointerException</span> will be thrown.  D. The default  <span class="text-monospace">Cake</span> recipe will be printed for each  <span class="text-monospace">Cake</span>.  E. The correct recipe for each  <span class="text-monospace">Cake</span> in  <span class="text-monospace">cakeArray</span> will be printed.
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Answer: E   This is an example of polymorphism: The correct <span class="text-monospace">printRecipe</span> method will be selected at run time for each subclass of <span class="text-monospace">Cake</span>. Note that because you are told that the <span class="text-monospace">cakeArray</span> is correctly initialized, you may assume that each entry is a valid concrete subclass of <span class="text-monospace">Cake</span>. Choice A is false because the enhanced <span class="text-monospace">for</span> loop accesses each element in the array without accessing indices. Choice B is false because a <span class="text-monospace">ConcurrentModificationException</span> is thrown if an attempt is made in an enhanced for loop to add an object to a collection. Printing the recipes doesn’t do this. Choice C is false because a <span class="text-monospace">NullPointerException</span> would be thrown if an attempt were made to call a method with a null object, which isn’t true here. Choice D is false because you are told that the <span class="text-monospace">printRecipe</span> method has been overridden in each of the subclasses. Therefore, during runtime the correct, overridden method for each type of <span class="text-monospace">cake will be printed.</span>

A. The array is sorted by ID number.  B. The array is in alphabetical order by name.  C. The array is sorted by ID number and alphabetically by name.  D. The ID number key is in the array.  E. No two students in the array have the same name.
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
Answer: A    For this search, the key being searched for is an ID number. Therefore, the array must be sorted by ID number. Suppose the key being searched for was a student's name. Then the array would need to be sorted by name to use a binary search.

6.  Given that all sorting algorithms strive to be efficient in terms of time and memory usage, which of the following is the biggest disadvantage of merge sort?
A. The algorithm uses recursion.  B. The algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer algorithm, which is inefficient.  C. It requires a temporary array.  D. In its worst case it is very inefficient.  E. The merge method is inefficient.
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Answer: C    A temporary array in a recursive method slows it down because the array is created for each recursive call. The other choices are incorrect. For choice A, without recursion merge sort would lose its elegance. For choice B, divide-and-conquer algorithms are some of the <i>most</i> efficient algorithms. For choice D, there is not much difference in the efficiency for best, average, and worst cases. For choice E, because of the divide-and-conquer aspect of merge sort, it is more efficient than selection sort or insertion sort, for example.

A. <span class="text-monospace">getBalance //return balance for this BankAccount</span>  B. <span class="text-monospace">getInterestRate //return interest rate for all BankAccounts</span>  C. <span class="text-monospace">checkForMinimumBalance //check that BankAccount has sufficient funds</span>  D. <span class="text-monospace">deposit //deposit some amount in this BankAccount</span>  E. <span class="text-monospace">getPassword //return password for this BankAccount</span>
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Answer: B   The method <span class="text-monospace">getInterestRate</span> is the only method that applies to more than one <span class="text-monospace">BankAccount</span>. It should therefore be static. All of the other methods relate directly to one particular <span class="text-monospace">BankAccount</span> object.

Consider method  <span class="text-monospace">newArray</span> below.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg97_01.png"/>  Suppose  <span class="text-monospace">newArray</span> is executed with the array  <span class="text-monospace">{5,0,3,0,1}</span> as its parameter. Which of the following represents the array that is returned by the method?
A. <span class="text-monospace">{5,3,1,0,0}</span>  B. <span class="text-monospace">{5,3,1,0,1}</span>  C. <span class="text-monospace">{5,3,1}</span>  D. <span class="text-monospace">{0,0,5,3,1}</span>  E. <span class="text-monospace">{0,0,0,5,3,1}</span>
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Answer: C    Given that <span class="text-monospace">arr1</span> originally holds the elements <span class="text-monospace">5</span>, <span class="text-monospace">0</span>, <span class="text-monospace">3</span>, <span class="text-monospace">0</span>, <span class="text-monospace">0</span>, <span class="text-monospace">1</span>. After the first <span class="text-monospace">for</span> loop, <span class="text-monospace">arr1</span> has been changed to <span class="text-monospace">5</span>, <span class="text-monospace">3</span>, <span class="text-monospace">1</span>, <span class="text-monospace">0</span>, <span class="text-monospace">0</span>, <span class="text-monospace">1</span>, and <span class="text-monospace">count</span>, which has counted the nonzero elements, equals <span class="text-monospace">3</span>. Array <span class="text-monospace">arr2</span> is created with 3 slots and, after execution of the second <span class="text-monospace">for</span> loop, contains <span class="text-monospace">5</span>, <span class="text-monospace">3</span>, <span class="text-monospace">1</span>. In the final line of code, <span class="text-monospace">arr1</span> is reassigned to contain these same elements. The algorithm had the effect of removing all zeros from <span class="text-monospace">arr1</span>.

Question: 285
1.  Consider the following method.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/comp_prin_2ac.png"/>  What is the result of the method call  <span class="text-monospace">mystery</span>(" <span class="text-monospace">I have a dream</span>")?
A. <span class="text-monospace">Ihaveadream</span>  B. <span class="text-monospace">I have a dream</span>  C. <span class="text-monospace">Ihave</span>  D. <span class="text-monospace">adream</span>  E. <span class="text-monospace">dream</span>
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Answer: E   The test <span class="text-monospace">s.indexOf(BLANK) != -1</span> is true if there’s at least one blank in <span class="text-monospace">s</span>. The loop assigns to <span class="text-monospace">s</span> the substring following the first blank in <span class="text-monospace">s</span>. When there are no more blanks in <span class="text-monospace">s</span>, the loop test becomes false, and <span class="text-monospace">s</span> contains the last word of the original string.

2.  Which of the following would be the least suitable as a Java class in this program?
A. <span class="text-monospace">Teacher</span>  B. <span class="text-monospace">Schedule</span>  C. <span class="text-monospace">Student</span>  D. <span class="text-monospace">ClassroomList</span>  E. <span class="text-monospace">Course</span>
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Answer: C   While student names will feature in this program, a <span class="text-monospace">Student</span> object isn’t useful in the program. The need for the other classes is clear. Choice A: A <span class="text-monospace">Teacher</span> would have a name and a schedule. Choice B: A <span class="text-monospace">Schedule</span> would have a list of courses, classrooms, and periods. Choice D: A <span class="text-monospace">ClassroomList</span> is necessary for keeping track of classroom use. Choice E: A <span class="text-monospace">Course</span> could have a teacher label, periods taught, and classrooms used.

Question: 287
3.  Which of the following activities, performed by the programmer, would be an example of procedural abstraction?
A. Deciding to use methods  <span class="text-monospace">getCourses</span> and  <span class="text-monospace">getPeriods</span> to set up a  <span class="text-monospace">Schedule</span> for a  <span class="text-monospace">Teacher</span>.  B. Combining the data fields  <span class="text-monospace">name</span> and  <span class="text-monospace">schedule</span> with methods needed in a  <span class="text-monospace">Teacher</span> class.  C. Using private methods in the  <span class="text-monospace">Teacher</span> class to restrict access to some information.  D. Implementing the controller class  <span class="text-monospace">ScheduleManager</span> first, followed by the lower-level subsidiary classes.  E. Writing a <span class="text-monospace">Display</span> class first so that classes like  <span class="text-monospace">Teacher</span> and  <span class="text-monospace">Course</span> can be tested early in the development process.
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
Answer: A   Procedural abstraction is the process of coming up with separate methods that will encapsulate each behavior in a class. Each of the other choices is incorrect. Choice B is an example of <i>encapsulation</i>, the combining of data fields and methods in a class. Choice C is an example of <i>information hiding</i>, using <span class="text-monospace">private</span> to restrict access. Choice D is an example of <i>top-down development</i>, implementing the main classes first, the lower-level classes later. Choice E is not an example of anything in particular. While it may be a good idea, it’s not an example of procedural abstraction.

Question: 288
4.  Consider the class <span class="text-monospace">WordPrinter</span> below, which has a recursive method  <span class="text-monospace">printSomething</span>.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/comp_prin_2ad.png"/>  What will be output by the following method call?  <span class="text-monospace">Â Â Â Â Â printSomething(245);</span>
A. <span class="text-monospace">five four two</span>  B. <span class="text-monospace">two hundred forty five</span>  C. <span class="text-monospace">two four five</span>  D. <span class="text-monospace">two five four</span>  E. <span class="text-monospace">four two five</span>
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Answer: C   Each time a recursive call is made to <span class="text-monospace">printSomething</span>, execution goes back to the start of a new method call, but must remember to execute the pending statements for each call. <span class="text-monospace">printSomething(245)</span> calls <span class="text-monospace">printSomething(24)</span> and stacks <span class="text-monospace">System.out.print(" ")</span> and <span class="text-monospace">printDigit(5)</span>. Then <span class="text-monospace">printSomething(24)</span> calls <span class="text-monospace">printSomething(2)</span> and stacks <span class="text-monospace">System.out.print(" ")</span> and <span class="text-monospace">printDigit(4)</span>. The stack of pending calls can be pictured as follows: <div> <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/t2_s1_034.png"/>   Finally, <span class="text-monospace">printSomething(2)</span> is a base case, so <span class="text-monospace">two</span> is printed. Now the stack is popped from the top, producing the output <span class="text-monospace">two four five</span>.

Question: 289
5.  Which of the following preconditions suggests using an insertion sort, rather than some other sorting algorithm?
A. The elements are already sorted.  B. The elements are sorted in reverse sorted order.  C. The elements are in random order.  D. The elements are integers.  E. Best case, average case, and worst case are the same.
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
Answer: A    Recall that in insertion sort, the first element, <span class="text-monospace">a[0]</span>, can be thought of as being sorted with respect to itself. Think of the array as consisting of two lists, a sorted list followed by an unsorted list. Each element in the unsorted list is moved into the sorted part by finding its insertion point and then shifting elements to create a slot. If the array is already sorted, then the insertion point for any element will be its current position. There will be no more than one test for each element and no shifting of elements to create a slot-the best case for insertion sort.  The worst case is the array sorted in reverse order, choice B. This is because the insertion point will always be at the front of the array, causing the maximum possible number of tests and data moves. Choice C represents an average case, where one could expect a large number of tests and data moves about half the time. Choice D is completely wrong: The type of elements in the array does not affect the efficiency of the sorting algorithm.

Question: 290
6.  Consider a matrix with the declaration  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg104_01.png"/>  where  <span class="text-monospace">nRows</span> and  <span class="text-monospace">nCols</span> are positive integers.  The following code segment is intended to replace all single-character strings inthe matrix with the empty string.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg104_02.png"/>  Which replacements for  <span class="text-monospace">/* missing code 1 */</span> and  <span class="text-monospace">/* missing code 2 */</span>, respectively, will cause the segment to work as intended?  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/comp_prin_2ae.png"/>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I and III only
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Answer: C   The point of this question is that you should know that the number of rows in matrix <span class="text-monospace">m</span> is given by <span class="text-monospace">m.length</span> and the number of columns is <span class="text-monospace">m[r].length</span>, where <span class="text-monospace">m[r]</span> is row <span class="text-monospace">r</span> in the matrix. <span class="text-monospace">/* missing code 1 */</span> traverses the rows, so you need the test <span class="text-monospace">r&lt;strMat.length</span>, while <span class="text-monospace">/* missing code 2 */</span> traverses the columns, so you need the test <span class="text-monospace">c&lt;strMat[r].length</span>. Only segment III uses the correct test in each piece of missing code.

Question: 291
7.  Of the following pairs of methods, which should be coded and tested first to facilitate  testing and debugging the other methods?
A. The constructor and  <span class="text-monospace">add</span> method  B. The constructor and  <span class="text-monospace">compareTo</span> method  C. The constructor and  <span class="text-monospace">toString</span> method  D. The  <span class="text-monospace">toString</span> and  <span class="text-monospace">compareTo</span> methods  E. The  <span class="text-monospace">toString</span> and one of the  <span class="text-monospace">add</span>,  <span class="text-monospace">subtract</span>, or  <span class="text-monospace">multiply</span> methods
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Answer: C   Before manipulating <span class="text-monospace">LargeInt</span> objects, you have to check that they've been correctly constructed, and to do that you need to output them. This means that the <span class="text-monospace">toString</span> method must be defined in order to read the output easily. Therefore, the constructor and <span class="text-monospace">toString</span> methods should be coded before the others.

Question: 292
8.  Consider the problem of simulating the following loop for  <span class="text-monospace">LargeInt</span> objects.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/comp_prin_2ag.png"> </img>  The following code is used. You may assume that  <span class="text-monospace">n</span> exists and is of type  <span class="text-monospace">LargeInt</span>.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/comp_prin_2ah.png"/>   Which of the following should replace  <span class="text-monospace">/*  <i>statement to increment i by one</i>  */</span> to simulate the loop correctly?
A. <span class="text-monospace">i = i.add(one);</span>  B. <span class="text-monospace">i = i.add(1);</span>  C. <span class="text-monospace">i = one.add(n);</span>  D. <span class="text-monospace">i = n.add(one);</span>  E. <span class="text-monospace">i = i.add(n);</span>
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
Answer: A   You want to simulate <span class="text-monospace">i++</span> (or <span class="text-monospace">i=i+1</span>). Thus, eliminate choices C and D, which don't include <span class="text-monospace">i</span> in the method calls to <span class="text-monospace">add</span>. Choice C would be correct if its method call were <span class="text-monospace">one.add(i)</span>. Eliminate choice B because a <span class="text-monospace">LargeInt</span> parameter must be used. Choice E is wrong because you're not adding <span class="text-monospace">n</span> to <span class="text-monospace">i</span>, you're adding <span class="text-monospace">1</span> to <span class="text-monospace">i</span>.

9.  Consider "triangles" that are formed by stacking squares, each with area 1. <div>  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/t2_s1_039.png"> </img>   The area of each such triangle is a <i>triangular number</i>. Note that the area of the <i>n</i>th such triangle equals the area of the (<i>n</i>-1)th triangle plus the area of the new base. Here is a  <span class="text-monospace">Triangle</span> class that provides code to find the area of these  <span class="text-monospace">Triangle</span> objects, given their base.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg109_01.png"/>  Which of the following replacements for  <span class="text-monospace">/* code to find area of triangle */</span> will correctly find the area of a triangle with the specified base?  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg109_02.png"/>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Answer: E    All of the <span class="text-monospace">getArea</span> methods should work correctly in a client program. In the recursive methods used in segments I and II, the area of the triangle is found by adding the area of the current base to the area of the base of the previous triangle:  <span class="text-monospace">base + area (base - 1)</span>   Because this is done recursively, the effect is   <span class="text-monospace">base + (base - 1) + (base - 2) + Â· Â· Â· + 1</span>   where 1 is the base case. Segment III, the iterative algorithm, does the same thing starting at 1:   <span class="text-monospace">1 + 2 + 3 + Â· Â· Â· + base</span>

Question: 294
10.  A <i>perfect shuffle</i> is defined as one in which an array is split in half and the two halves are thenperfectly interleaved. (The process can then be repeated to shuffle the deck.) Ifthe array has an odd number of elements, the middle element is included with the firsthalf of the array, which will have one more element than the second half.  The algorithm is performed using a temporary array for the interleaving process, and     "shuffled" elements are then copied back. Consider an array of integers,Â  <span class="text-monospace">nums</span>, and let  <span class="text-monospace">temp</span> be the temporary array after one pass of the perfect shuffle algorithm, before the     elements are copied back to  <span class="text-monospace">nums</span>.   Example 1:  <div> <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/t2_s1_040a.png"/>    Example 2:  <div> <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/t2_s1_040b.png"/>   The following implementation of the perfect shuffle method does not work as intended.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg111_01.png"/>  Which of the following is a problem with the given implementation of the perfect shufflemethod? <ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman">  Executing  <span class="text-monospace">perfectShuffle</span> may cause an  <span class="text-monospace">ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</span>.   The <span class="text-monospace">perfectShuffle</span> algorithm will not work if the type of elements in the array is something other than <span class="text-monospace">int</span>.   If  <span class="text-monospace">nums.length</span> is even, one or more of  <span class="text-monospace">nums[0]...nums[nums.length/2]</span> will be copied to the wrong position in the  <span class="text-monospace">temp</span> array.  </ol>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and III only  E. None of I, II, or III is the problem
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
Answer: A   An <span class="text-monospace">ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</span> will be thrown when <span class="text-monospace">nums.length</span> is odd. When <span class="text-monospace">nums.length</span> is odd, the first loop must copy one more element than the second loop does. Thismeans that <span class="text-monospace">k</span> in the first loop must go up to and including <span class="text-monospace">(nums.length+1)/2</span>, and in the second loop, <span class="text-monospace">k</span> must start at <span class="text-monospace">(nums.length+1)/2</span>. As written, in the second half of the algorithm, there will be too many elementsto copy, and <span class="text-monospace">tempIndex</span> will go out of range while <span class="text-monospace">k</span> still satisfies the test<br/><span class="text-monospace">while (k &lt; nums.length)</span>  Note that statement II is false because the <span class="text-monospace">perfectShuffle</span> algorithm is independent of the data type in the array. Statement III is false because <span class="text-monospace">perfectShuffle</span> works as intended when <span class="text-monospace">nums.length</span> is even.

Question: 295
1.  A student's test score can be any real number between 0 and 100. The intent of thefollowing class is to print a student's score as a letter grade.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg130_01.png"/>  Consider the following segment of a client program.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/comp_prin_3a.png"/>  If  <span class="text-monospace">testScore</span> is 75.0, what will be output?
A. <span class="text-monospace">Average score.<br/>Barely passing.<br/>Failing score.</span>  B. <span class="text-monospace">Average score.<br/>Barely passing.</span>  C. <span class="text-monospace">Average score.</span>  D. <span class="text-monospace">Congratulations!<br/>Good job.<br/>Average score.</span>  E. An error message will be output.
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Answer: B   The intent of the programmer is to output  <span class="text-monospace">   Average score.</span> However, because <span class="text-monospace">else</span> is not used, each of the <span class="text-monospace">if</span> statements will be executed and two lines will be printed. The first is printed whenthe program passes the <span class="text-monospace">if (score &gt;= 70.0)</span> test, the second when it passes the <span class="text-monospace">if (score &gt;= 60.0)</span> test. The programmer can avoid this either by using a sequence of <span class="text-monospace">else if</span> tests, thus excluding all other tests when one is found to be true, or by returningthe appropriate string (with a <span class="text-monospace">return</span> statement) as soon as a test is true.

4.  Consider the following classes, where  <span class="text-monospace">Clown</span> and  <span class="text-monospace">Acrobat</span> are subclasses of  <span class="text-monospace">CircusPerformer</span>. <div>  <img src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/t3_s1_004.png"> </img>    Which of the following is a <i>true</i> statement about the classes shown?
A. Each of the classes- <span class="text-monospace">CircusPerformer</span>,  <span class="text-monospace">Clown</span>, and  <span class="text-monospace">Acrobat</span>-can have a method  <span class="text-monospace">doTrick</span> that has different code.  B. Both  <span class="text-monospace">Clown</span> and  <span class="text-monospace">Acrobat</span> inherit the constructors in  <span class="text-monospace">CircusPerformer</span>.  C. If  <span class="text-monospace">CircusPerformer</span> has a private instance variable  <span class="text-monospace">routine</span>, both  <span class="text-monospace">Clown</span> and  <span class="text-monospace">Acrobat</span> can directly access it.  D. If  <span class="text-monospace">CircusPerformer</span> has a private method  <span class="text-monospace">tumble</span>, both  <span class="text-monospace">Clown</span> and  <span class="text-monospace">Acrobat</span> can access it.  E. If  <span class="text-monospace">Clown</span> has a private instance variable  <span class="text-monospace">jokes</span>,  <span class="text-monospace">CircusPerformer</span> can access it.
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
Answer: A    Statement A is true because the <span class="text-monospace">doTrick</span> method can be overridden in each of its subclasses. Choice B is false because constructors are never inherited. If a subclass has no constructor, the default constructor for the superclass is generated. If the superclass does not have a default constructor, a compile-time error will occur. Choice C is false because the subclasses cannot directly access private instance variables of the superclass. (What they can do is use accessor methods of the superclass.) Choice D is false because a private method in any class can only be accessed in the code of that class. Choice E is false because a superclass cannot access the private instance variables of its subclasses.

Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Answer: C   The private instance variable <span class="text-monospace">total</span> must be incremented by <span class="text-monospace">amt</span>. Choices A and B are wrong because <span class="text-monospace">incrementTotal</span> is <span class="text-monospace">void</span> and should not return a value. Choice D is wrong because you can't use a method call as the left-hand side of an assignment. Also, in choice D the total is not being changed. Choice E <i>replaces </i> <span class="text-monospace">total</span> with <span class="text-monospace">amt</span> instead of incrementing it.

Question: 302
8.  Consider the following guessing game:  Consider the problem of writing a game in which a user thinks of an integer from 1 to 1,000 inclusive and the computer tries to guess that number. Each time the computer makes a guess, the user makes one of three responses:   "lower" (i.e., the number is lower than the computer's guess)  "higher" (i.e., the number is higher than the computer's guess)  "you got it in &lt; <i>however many</i> &gt; tries!"    Suppose the game is programmed so that the computer uses a binary search strategyfor making its guesses. What is the maximum number of guesses the computer could makebefore guessing the user's number?
A. 9  B. 10  C. 100  D. 500  E. 1,000
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Answer: B   The computer should find the number in no more than 10 tries. This is because the guessing interval is halved on each successive try:  <span class="text-monospace">(1) 1,<span class="cambria">000</span> Ã· 2 = 5<span class="cambria">00</span> numbers left to try<br/> (2)  5<span class="cambria">00</span> Ã· 2 = 25<span class="cambria">0</span> numbers left to try<br/> (3)  25<span class="cambria">0</span> Ã· 2 = 125   numbers left to try<br/> (4)  125 Ã· 2 =  63  numbers left to try (at most)<br/> (5)  63 Ã· 2 =  32  numbers left to try (at most)<br/> (6)  32 Ã· 2 =  16  numbers left to try<br/> (7)  16 Ã· 2 =  8  numbers left to try<br/> (8)   8 Ã· 2 =  4  numbers left to try<br/> (9)   4 Ã· 2 =  2  numbers left to try<br/> (1<span class="cambria">0</span>)  2 Ã· 2 =  1   number left to try<br/></span>  Ten iterations of the loop leaves just 1 number left to try. Alternatively, round 1,000 to the nearest higher power of 2: 1,000 ≃ 1,024 = 2<sup>10</sup>. The maximum number of guesses (worst case) equals the exponent, 10.

Question: 303
9.  Consider the following guessing game:  Consider the problem of writing a game in which a user thinks of an integer from 1 to 1,000 inclusive and the computer tries to guess that number. Each time the computer makes a guess, the user makes one of three responses:   "lower" (i.e., the number is lower than the computer's guess)  "higher" (i.e., the number is higher than the computer's guess)  "you got it in &lt; <i>however many</i> &gt; tries!"    Suppose the computer starts by guessing a random integer between 1 and 1,000, andthen uses a <i>sequential search</i> strategy to find the user's number. What is the maximum number of guesses the computercould make before guessing the user's number?
A. 50  B. 250  C. 500  D. 999  E. 1,000
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
Answer: D   The maximum number of guesses is 999. Suppose the user's number is 1,000 and the computer's first guess happens to be 1. In a sequential search, the computer will try each successive number until it gets to 999. Therefore, in this worst case, the computer will take 999 guesses to reach the user's number. If 999 isn’t the user’s number, then the user’s number must be 1000.

Question: 304
10.  Consider this hierarchy of classes: <div> <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/comp_prin_3c.png"/>   The  <span class="text-monospace">Entree</span> class has a method  <span class="text-monospace">printRecipe</span> with the following header.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg138_01.png"/>  The method is overridden in each of the subclasses shown above. A client class  <span class="text-monospace">RecipeBook</span> has a private instance variable  <span class="text-monospace">allRecipes</span> declared as follows.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg138_02.png"/>  Assuming that  <span class="text-monospace">allRecipes</span> is correctly initialized, the following piece of code is now executed to print a recipe for each subclass dish.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg138_03.png"/>  Which concept is illustrated by this code?
A. Overloaded methods  B. Polymorphism  C. Information hiding  D. Procedural abstraction  E. Encapsulation
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Answer: B   Using polymorphism, the correct <span class="text-monospace">printRecipe</span> method for a given subclass will be selected at run time. Note that the <span class="text-monospace">printRecipe</span> method must be overridden in each of the <span class="text-monospace">Entree</span> subclasses for this to happen correctly. Recall that:    overloaded methods are two or more methods in the same class that have the same name but different parameter lists.    information hiding is the use of <span class="text-monospace">private</span> to restrict access.    procedural abstraction is using separate methods to encapsulate each task in a class.   encapsulation is the combining of data fields and methods in a class.

Question: 305
1.  Which is a <i>false</i> statement about static methods?
A. A static method can use a static variable in its implementation code.  B. If a class is such that it doesn't make sense to ever create an object of the class, then all methods of that class should be static.  C. All methods in a class that has a main method and no private data fields should be static.  D. A static method should not be invoked by an object of a class.  E. Accessor methods in an object class may be static, depending on the value that's being accessed.
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Answer: E    It doesn't make sense to make an accessor static, because an object will then not be able to invoke that method! Note that a static method belongs to the whole class, not an instance of it. It therefore should be invoked in a client class by using the name of the class that defines the method. For example, for a <span class="text-monospace">BankAccount</span> class one might have <span class="text-monospace">BankAccount.getInterestRate().</span> If a specific class object is used to invoke the method (instead of the class name), a good compiler will give a warning that this usage is discouraged.

Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
Answer: D    What you need is to produce a random integer in the range 0 to 10, inclusive, and then shift the range by 20. The expression   <span class="text-monospace">   (int) (Math.random() * 11)</span>   produces a random integer from 0 to 10, inclusive. (Note that there are 11 possible numbers.) Adding 20 gives the required range.

3.  Consider the following class definitions.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/comp_prin_3r.png"/>  Assuming that both <span class="text-monospace">Flyer</span> and  <span class="text-monospace">Bird</span>  have default constructors, which is (are) valid in a client class? <ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman">   <span class="text-monospace">Flyer f1 = new Bird();</span>     <span class="text-monospace">Bird b = new Sparrow();</span>     <span class="text-monospace">Flyer f2 = new Sparrow();</span>   </ol>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Answer: E   All satisfy the <i>is-a</i> test. <span class="text-monospace">Bird</span> <i>is-a</i> <span class="text-monospace">Flyer</span>; <span class="text-monospace">Sparrow</span> <i>is-a</i> <span class="text-monospace">Bird</span>; <span class="text-monospace">Sparrow</span> <i>is-a</i> <span class="text-monospace">Flyer</span>. Note: Because <span class="text-monospace">Sparrow</span> <i>is-a</i> <span class="text-monospace">Bird</span>, it automatically inherits the methods of <span class="text-monospace">Bird</span>, its superclass. Since <span class="text-monospace">Flyer</span> and <span class="text-monospace">Bird</span> have default constructors, when a new <span class="text-monospace">Sparrow</span> is created, the compiler will slot this code into the <span class="text-monospace">Sparrow</span> class:  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg141_02.png"/>  There would be an error if the superclass did not have a default constructor.

A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. II and III only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
Answer: A   Method call I works because <span class="text-monospace">Sparrow</span> inherits all the methods of <span class="text-monospace">Bird</span>. Method call II fails because <span class="text-monospace">Bird</span>, the superclass, does not inherit the methods of <span class="text-monospace">Sparrow</span>, its subclass. Method call III uses a parameter that fails the <i>is-a</i> test: <span class="text-monospace">b</span> is not a <span class="text-monospace">Sparrow</span>, which the parameter requires.

A. It prints string  <span class="text-monospace">s</span>.  B. It prints string  <span class="text-monospace">s</span> in reverse order.  C. It prints only the first character of string  <span class="text-monospace">s</span>.  D. It prints only the first two characters of string  <span class="text-monospace">s</span>.  E. It prints only the last character of string  <span class="text-monospace">s</span>.
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
Answer: A    Because the recursive call is made at the end of the method, the <span class="text-monospace">System.out.print...</span> statements are executed at the <i>beginning</i> of each method call, causing the letters of the string to be printed out in order. If the two statements in the method were interchanged, so that the recursive call is made at the beginning of the method, then the pending <span class="text-monospace">print...</span> methods would be stacked up, causing the string to be printed in reverse order.

A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and III only  E. II and III only
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
Answer: D    Because the values in <span class="text-monospace">arr</span> cannot be less than <span class="text-monospace">Integer.MIN_VALUE</span>, the test in the <span class="text-monospace">while</span> loop will be true at least once and will lead to the largest element being stored in <span class="text-monospace">max</span>. (If <i>all</i> the elements of the array are <span class="text-monospace">Integer.MIN_VALUE</span>, the code still works.) Similarly, initializing <span class="text-monospace">max</span> to <span class="text-monospace">arr[0]</span>, the first element in the array, ensures that all elements in <span class="text-monospace">arr</span> will be examined and the largest will be found. Choice II, <span class="text-monospace">Integer.MAX_VALUE</span>, fails because the test in the loop will always be false! There is no array element that will be greater than the largest possible integer. The method will (incorrectly) return <span class="text-monospace">Integer.MAX_VALUE</span>.

Question: 311
7.  An opera company has a large list of donor records, sorted alphabetically by name. Each record contains the amount of money donated in the current year. Which of the following represents the most efficient way to find the name of the top donor in the current year?
A. Insertion sort of the records  B. Selection sort of the records  C. Merge sort of the records  D. Binary search of the records  E. Sequential search of the records
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Answer: E    Because the records are not sorted by amount, each record must be examined to find the one with the largest amount. It therefore doesn't make sense to sort the elements, which involves both examination and movement of elements. So you can eliminate choices A, B, and C. Choice D, the binary search, is wrong because a binary search for an amount can only be done if the list is sorted on that key field. The given list of records is sorted by name, not amount.

A. <span class="text-monospace">n</span> if  <span class="text-monospace">n</span> is even and  <span class="text-monospace">n + 1</span> if  <span class="text-monospace">n</span> is odd  B. <span class="text-monospace">2</span> <span class="text-monospace">n</span> if  <span class="text-monospace">n</span> is even and  <span class="text-monospace">2 n - 1</span> if  <span class="text-monospace">n</span> is odd  C. <span class="text-monospace">n/2</span> if  <span class="text-monospace">n</span> is even and <span class="text-monospace">1</span> +  <span class="text-monospace">n/2</span> if  <span class="text-monospace">n</span> is odd  D. <span class="text-monospace">n % 2</span> if n is even and <span class="text-monospace">1 + n % 2</span> if <span class="text-monospace">n</span> is odd  E. <span class="text-monospace">2<sup>n</sup></span> if  <span class="text-monospace">n</span> is even and <span class="text-monospace">2<sup>n</sup></span> - <span class="text-monospace">1</span> if  <span class="text-monospace">n</span> is odd
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Answer: C   If you consider a small even number like <span class="text-monospace">4</span>, the loop will be executed when <span class="text-monospace">i</span> is <span class="text-monospace">4</span> and <span class="text-monospace">2</span>, twice. This eliminates choices A, B, and E. If <span class="text-monospace">n</span> is <span class="text-monospace">8</span>, the loop is executed when <span class="text-monospace">i</span> is <span class="text-monospace">8</span>, <span class="text-monospace">6</span>, <span class="text-monospace">4</span>, and <span class="text-monospace">2</span>, four times. Since <span class="text-monospace">n % 2</span> is 0 this eliminates choice D. Notice that choice C also works for any odd integer, <span class="text-monospace">7</span> say. The loop will execute when <span class="text-monospace">i</span> is <span class="text-monospace">7</span>, <span class="text-monospace">5</span>, <span class="text-monospace">3</span>, and <span class="text-monospace">1</span>, four times or <span class="text-monospace">7/2 + 1</span>.

A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. II and III only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Answer: C   Declaration I clearly works because there is a default constructor in the <span class="text-monospace">PosInt</span> class. The reason declaration II works is that, because the superclass <span class="text-monospace">PosInt</span> has a default constructor, the following code will automatically be placed in the subclass <span class="text-monospace">EvenPosInt</span>:  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg147_02.png"/>  This only works for a default constructor. So declaration III fails because superclass constructors are not inherited. You need to add the following constructor code to <span class="text-monospace">EvenPosInt</span> to make declaration III work:  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg147_03.png"/>

Consider a  <span class="text-monospace">Date</span> class whose partial representation is shown below.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg149_01.png"/>  Consider the following declarations.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/comp_prin_3h.png"/>  Based on the given information, which of the following statements <i>must</i> be true?
A. The test  <span class="text-monospace">if (d1 == d2)</span> is  <span class="text-monospace">true</span>.  B. The test  <span class="text-monospace">if (d1.equals(d2))</span> will cause a compile-time error.  C.

E. The test  <span class="text-monospace">if (d1.compareTo(d2) == 0)</span> will cause a compile-time error.
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Answer: E   To use the <span class="text-monospace">compareTo</span> method without a compiler error, the class should have a <span class="text-monospace">compareTo</span> method defined, which you are told has not been done. Each of the other statements is false: for choice A, when two objects are compared using <span class="text-monospace">==</span>, the test is false if <span class="text-monospace">d1</span> and <span class="text-monospace">d2</span> are not the same reference. Choice B is false because every class inherits the <span class="text-monospace">equals</span> method from the universal superclass <span class="text-monospace">Object</span>. For choice C, the test will return <span class="text-monospace">true</span> only if the <span class="text-monospace">equals</span> method is overridden in class <span class="text-monospace">Date</span> in such a way that two <span class="text-monospace">Date</span> objects are equal if their <span class="text-monospace">month</span>, <span class="text-monospace">day</span>, and <span class="text-monospace">year</span> data fields are equal. Because you don't know whether <span class="text-monospace">equals</span> has been overridden, you can't state that choice C is true. For choice D, the test can't be true if it doesn't compile. Note: An alternative way to have the <span class="text-monospace">compareTo</span> method compile without error is for the <span class="text-monospace">Date</span> class to implement the <span class="text-monospace">Comparable</span> interface. You are not required to know this for the AP exam.

Segment I will compile without error, because the superclass, <span class="text-monospace">Dancer</span>, has a default constructor. However, the specialty assigned to a new <span class="text-monospace">BalletDancer</span> will be that in the default constructor of a <span class="text-monospace">Dancer</span>, which was not the intent of the constructor with a parameter. Segment III fails because a subclass cannot directly access the private data of its superclass.

Question: 318
4.  Consider the following declarations.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg153_01.png"/>  A client class has an  <span class="text-monospace">ArrayList&lt;Performer&gt; performers</span> that is initialized with many different objects that are subclasses of  <span class="text-monospace">Performer</span>. Each subclass has an overridden  <span class="text-monospace">doRoutine</span> method, similar to those shown in the  <span class="text-monospace">Dancer</span> and  <span class="text-monospace">BalletDancer</span> classes. What is the effect of executing the following code segment?  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg153_02.png"/>
A. The unique routine for each particular  <span class="text-monospace">Performer</span> will be output.  B. The string "<span class="text-monospace">Do something special.</span>" will be printed for each <span class="text-monospace">p</span> in <span class="text-monospace">performers</span>.  C. The string "<span class="text-monospace">Backflip and spin.</span>" will be printed for each <span class="text-monospace">p</span> in <span class="text-monospace">performers</span>.  D. There will be a compile-time error with a message to the effect that there cannotbe different types in  <span class="text-monospace">ArrayList&lt;Performer&gt;</span>.  E. A run-time error will occur.
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
Answer: A   The code will work as intended; namely, at run time, the appropriate <span class="text-monospace">doRoutine</span> method will be called, depending on the current instance of <span class="text-monospace">Performer p</span>. This is an example of polymorphism or dynamic binding. Polymorphism occurs when a superclass method has been overridden in the subclass(es).

Question: 319
5.  A class has a two-dimensional squarearray.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/comp_prin_3i.png"/>  The array is initialized to have  <span class="text-monospace">SIZE</span> rows and columns. Consider the following method in the class.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg155_02.png"/>  Which of the following could be the resulting matrix after a call to <span class="text-monospace">fillArray("obtaining")</span>, assuming that the method runs without error? <ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman">  <span class="text-monospace">o b t aÂ </span>  <li class="no-number"><span class="text-monospace">i n i n</span>  <li class="no-number"><span class="text-monospace">g 0 0 0Â </span>  <li class="no-number"><span class="text-monospace">0 0 0 0</span>   <span class="text-monospace">o b tÂ </span>  <li class="no-number"><span class="text-monospace">a i n</span>  <li class="no-number"><span class="text-monospace">Â i n g</span>   <span class="text-monospace">o bÂ </span>  <li class="no-number"><span class="text-monospace">t a</span>  </ol>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Answer: E   All are correct, depending on whether <span class="text-monospace">SIZE</span> is 4, 3, or 2. The method fills the two-dimensional square array <span class="text-monospace">strMat</span> with single-character strings obtained with <span class="text-monospace">str.substring(i, i + 1)</span> in row-major order-the first row is filled from left to right, then the second row, and so on. When the test <span class="text-monospace">if (i &lt; str.length())</span> fails, the remaining matrix slots are filled with zeros, as in matrix I. Notice that if the number of slots in the matrix is less than the number of characters in <span class="text-monospace">str</span>, the method will quit without error before the entire string is processed, which is what happened for matrix III.

Question: 320
6.  Let  <span class="text-monospace">list</span> be an  <span class="text-monospace">ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;</span> containing these elements: <pre class="monospace image_move"><span class="text-monospace">4 5 6 2 1</span> </pre> Which of the following statements will cause an error? (You may assume that integers added to the list will automatically be wrappedâauto-boxedâinto  <span class="text-monospace">Integer</span> objects.)
A. <span class="text-monospace">list.add(5);</span>  B. <span class="text-monospace">list.add(2, 4);</span>  C. <span class="text-monospace">Integer intOb = list.get(5);</span>  D. <span class="text-monospace">Object ob = list.add(5, 7);</span>  E. <span class="text-monospace">Integer x = list.set(3, 0);</span>
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Answer: C   This statement will cause an <span class="text-monospace">IndexOutOfBoundsException</span> because there is no slot with index <span class="text-monospace">5</span>. Notice that choice D is correct: The size of the list will be adjusted to <span class="text-monospace">6</span>, and the <span class="text-monospace">Integer 7</span> will be added to the last slot, i.e., the slot with index <span class="text-monospace">5</span>.

7.  Refer to following method  <span class="text-monospace">insert</span>.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/comp_prin_3j.png"/>  Suppose that the element to be inserted has value  <span class="text-monospace">-8</span>. For which  <span class="text-monospace">list</span> will the method work as intended? <ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman">  8 4 0 -4   -2 -4 -6 -9   -1 -2 -4 -6  </ol>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. II and III only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Answer: B   Note that the method will <i>fail</i> whenever <span class="text-monospace">element</span> is less than the last item in the list, because <span class="text-monospace">index</span> will be incremented to a value that is out of bounds. This will happen in lists I and III. Because <span class="text-monospace">-8</span> is greater than <span class="text-monospace">-9</span> (list II), the test in the method will be false, preventing an out-of-range error.

Question: 322
8.  Refer to the following declarations.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg158_01.png"/>  Which of the following correctly assigns the elements of the  <span class="text-monospace">birds</span> array to  <span class="text-monospace">birdList</span>? The final ordering need not be the same as in the  <span class="text-monospace">birds</span> array.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg158_02.png"/>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and III only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  A
Explanation:
Answer: A    The declaration of the <span class="text-monospace">birds</span> array makes the following assignments: <span class="text-monospace">birds[0] = "robin"</span>, <span class="text-monospace">birds[1] = "parrot"</span>, and <span class="text-monospace">birds[2] = "bluejay"</span>. The loop in segment I adds these values to <span class="text-monospace">birdList</span> in the same order. Segment II fails because <span class="text-monospace">birds</span> is an array and therefore can't use the <span class="text-monospace">get</span> method. The code also confuses the lists. Segment III, in its first pass through the loop, attempts to add <span class="text-monospace">birds[2]</span> to index position <span class="text-monospace">2</span> of the <span class="text-monospace">birdList</span>. This will cause an <span class="text-monospace">IndexOutOfBoundsException</span> to be thrown, since index positions <span class="text-monospace">0</span> and <span class="text-monospace">1</span> do not yet exist.

Question: 323
9.  Consider the following  <span class="text-monospace">Item</span> and <span class="text-monospace">Sale</span> classes:  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg159_01.png"/>  Which of the following correctly replaces  <span class="text-monospace">/* code to create a new Item */</span> in the  <span class="text-monospace">Sale</span> constructor to initialize the  <span class="text-monospace">itemList</span> array?
A. <span class="text-monospace">new Item(getDescription(), getPrice());</span>  B. <span class="text-monospace">new Item(itemDescription, itemPrice);</span>  C. <span class="text-monospace">new itemList(getDescription(), getPrice());</span>  D. <span class="text-monospace">new itemList(itemDescription, itemPrice);</span>  E. <span class="text-monospace">new itemList(theNumItems);</span>
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Answer: B   For each <span class="text-monospace">i</span>, <span class="text-monospace">itemList[i]</span> is a new <span class="text-monospace">Item</span> object that must be constructed using the <span class="text-monospace">Item</span> constructor. Therefore, eliminate choices C, D, and E. Choice A is wrong because <span class="text-monospace">getDescription()</span> and <span class="text-monospace">getPrice()</span> are accessors for values <i>that already exist</i> for some <span class="text-monospace">Item</span> object.

10.  Consider the following  <span class="text-monospace">Item</span> and <span class="text-monospace">Sale</span> classes:  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg161_01.png"/>  Which represents correct  <span class="text-monospace">/* code to calculate amount */</span> in the  <span class="text-monospace">totalPaid</span> method?
A. <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg162_01.png"/>  B. <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg162_02.png"/>  C. <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg162_03.png"/>  D. <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg162_04.png"/>  E. <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg162_05.png"/>
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Answer: C   To access the price for each <span class="text-monospace">Item</span> in the <span class="text-monospace">itemList</span> array, the <span class="text-monospace">getPrice()</span> accessor in the <span class="text-monospace">Item</span> class must be used, because <span class="text-monospace">price</span> is private to that class. This eliminates choices A and E. Choice B uses <span class="text-monospace">itemList</span> incorrectly: There's no <span class="text-monospace">getPrice</span> method for an array object. Choices D and E incorrectly declare a <span class="text-monospace">Sale</span> object. (The method <span class="text-monospace">totalPaid</span> applies to an existing <span class="text-monospace">Sale</span> object.)

Question: 325
1.  Consider the <span class="text-monospace">insertionSort</span> method below, which does not always work as intended. The intention of the programmer is that the method will sort <span class="text-monospace">arr</span>, an array of integers, in descending order.  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg163_01.png"/>  The programmer intends that after <span class="text-monospace">k</span> passes through the outer loop, elements <span class="text-monospace">arr[0], arr[1], . . . arr[k]</span> will be sorted with respect to each other, but not necessarily in their final sorted position. Each element in the unsorted part of the array will be moved to the left, until its insertion point is found in the sorted part of the array and then inserted into that slot.  The method doesnât work as intended in every case.  Which of the following arrays will cause an error, if passed as a parameter to the method above?
A. <span class="text-monospace">8, 2, 1, 6, 4</span>  B. <span class="text-monospace">6, 5, 4, 3, 2</span>  C. <span class="text-monospace">4, 4, 3, 4, 4</span>  D. <span class="text-monospace">2, 8, 1, 5, 3</span>  E. <span class="text-monospace">9, 7, 8, 9, 4</span>
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
Answer: D   The problem will occur whenever there’s an element in the array that is larger than the element in the first slot. Because the <span class="text-monospace">while</span> loop has no range check on <span class="text-monospace">j</span>, any element larger than <span class="text-monospace">arr[0]</span> will sail off the left end of the array and result in an <span class="text-monospace">ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</span>. The problem can be fixed by changing the boolean test in the <span class="text-monospace">while</span> loop: <pre><span class="text-monospace">while (j &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; temp &gt; arr[j])</span></pre>

2.  The elements of array  <span class="text-monospace">arr</span> are to be sorted in increasing order. Which represents the first step of a merge sort algorithm?
A. Find the smallest element in  <span class="text-monospace">arr</span> and swap it into  <span class="text-monospace">arr[0]</span>.  B. Compare  <span class="text-monospace">arr[0]</span> with  <span class="text-monospace">arr[1]</span> and, if necessary, shift and replace elements such that  <span class="text-monospace">arr[0]</span> is less than  <span class="text-monospace">arr[1]</span>.  C. Compare  <span class="text-monospace">arr[0]</span> with the middle element of  <span class="text-monospace">arr</span>,  <span class="text-monospace">arr[mid]</span>, and if  <span class="text-monospace">arr[0]</span> is less than  <span class="text-monospace">arr[mid]</span>, swap these elements.  D. Compare the first and last elements, and if the first is less than the last, swap these elements.  E. Break the array into roughly two equal halves.
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Answer: E    Here's a recursive description of how merge sort works:   If there is more than one element in the array   Break the array into roughly two equal halves.   Merge sort the left half.   Merge sort the right half.   Merge the two subarrays into a sorted array.

4.  Consider the following program description.  A programmer plans to write a program that simulates a small card game (no more than four players). Each player will have a hand of ten cards, in which each card has a suit and a value. The game will involve either adding cards to a hand or discarding cards. The first player to have zero cards left in his hand is the winner. In the simulation, as the game is in progress, each player's hand is displayed on the screen.   The programmer plans to have a short class whose <span class="text-monospace">main</span> method has just two statements: <div class="s9-scrollable"> <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/qno33_01.png"> </img>   The <span class="text-monospace">Game</span> class will have several objects: a <span class="text-monospace">Display</span>, a <span class="text-monospace">Deck</span>, a <span class="text-monospace">Card</span>, and a <span class="text-monospace">PlayerGroup</span>. The <span class="text-monospace">PlayerGroup</span> will have a list of <span class="text-monospace">Player</span>s, and each <span class="text-monospace">Player</span> will have a <span class="text-monospace">Hand</span> of <span class="text-monospace">Card</span>s.  The relationship between the  <span class="text-monospace">Player</span> and  <span class="text-monospace">Hand</span> classes is an example of
A. inheritance  B. top-down design  C. information hiding  D. independent classes  E. composition
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Answer: E   Composition is the <i>has-a</i> relationship. A Player <i>has-a</i> <span class="text-monospace">Hand</span>. Inheritance (choice A) is the <i>is-a</i> relationship, which doesn’t apply here. None of the choices B, C, or D apply here. Top-down design is a style of designing a program, not a relation between classes. Information hiding is the use of <span class="text-monospace">private</span> to restrict access; and <span class="text-monospace">Player</span> is <i>dependent</i> on <span class="text-monospace">Hand</span>, becasue a <span class="text-monospace">Player</span> has a <span class="text-monospace">Hand</span>.

5.  Consider the following program description.  A programmer plans to write a program that simulates a small card game (no more than four players). Each player will have a hand of ten cards, in which each card has a suit and a value. The game will involve either adding cards to a hand or discarding cards. The first player to have zero cards left in his hand is the winner. In the simulation, as the game is in progress, each player's hand is displayed on the screen.

Which is a reasonable data structure for a  <span class="text-monospace">Hand</span> object? Each hand starts with ten cards, and the number of cards can only go down. There should be a mechanism for removing a card, displaying a card, and for detecting a winning hand (no cards left in it).  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/comp_prin_3k.png"/>
A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and III only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  D
Explanation:
Answer: D   Data structure III conveniently stores a list of <span class="text-monospace">Card</span>s in which <span class="text-monospace">Card</span>s can easily be removed using the <span class="text-monospace">remove</span> method of <span class="text-monospace">ArrayList</span>. The array in data structure II allows for all cards in a deck to be represented (either in the <span class="text-monospace">Hand</span> or not); however, it doesn't provide a way to represent the suits and values of the cards themselves or to display a card. The array of <span class="text-monospace">Card</span> in data structure I may seem unsuitable because an array has fixed length. However, when a card is removed, it is easy to represent this by replacing that card with <span class="text-monospace">null</span> in that array slot.

A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. II and III only
Correct Answer:  B
Explanation:
Answer: B    A <span class="text-monospace">NullPointerException</span> is thrown whenever an attempt is made to call a method with an object that hasn’t been created with <span class="text-monospace">new</span>. If the <span class="text-monospace">ArrayList</span> <span class="text-monospace">deck</span> was not created with <span class="text-monospace">new</span>, the method call <span class="text-monospace">deck.add(someCard)</span> would cause the <span class="text-monospace">NullPointerException</span>.  Choice I is incorrect because <span class="text-monospace">DeckTester</span> is an objectless class with a static main method, used to test objects in the program.  Choice III is wrong. No methods are called with a <span class="text-monospace">null Card</span> object. If an attempt is made to add a <span class="text-monospace">Card</span> to a deck without using the key word <span class="text-monospace">new</span>, the compiler will find the error before the program is run.

A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. II and III only
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Answer: E   Segment I is garbage: Subtraction of strings is meaningless. Segment II works: If <span class="text-monospace">fullName</span> is <span class="text-monospace">Jan P. Smith</span>, then the position of the first blank, <span class="text-monospace">index</span>, is <span class="text-monospace">3</span>. For the <span class="text-monospace">firstName</span>, you want the substring of <span class="text-monospace">fullName</span> from <span class="text-monospace">0</span> to <span class="text-monospace">2</span>. (Recall that the second parameter of substring is the first position you don't want.) Segment III is long-winded, but it works: For <span class="text-monospace">index-1</span> times it appends a single character string to <span class="text-monospace">s</span>, and then sets <span class="text-monospace">firstName</span> to contain <span class="text-monospace">s</span>.

A. I only  B. II only  C. III only  D. I and II only  E. I, II, and III
Correct Answer:  E
Explanation:
Answer: E   They are all correct! One version of <span class="text-monospace">substring</span> has a single parameter, <span class="text-monospace">startIndex</span>. The method returns the substring that starts at <span class="text-monospace">startIndex</span> and goes to the end of the string. Segment I uses this version, starting at the position immediately following the second blank. Another version of <span class="text-monospace">substring</span> has two parameters, <span class="text-monospace">startIndex</span> and <span class="text-monospace">endIndex</span>. In this case, the <span class="text-monospace">substring</span> method returns the substring that starts at <span class="text-monospace">startIndex</span> and goes up to <span class="text-monospace">endIndex-1</span>. Segment II correctly uses this version. Segment III uses the single-parameter version of <span class="text-monospace">substring</span>, taking care to start at the correct position of <span class="text-monospace">fullName</span>. If the actual name were <span class="text-monospace">Pat C. Clark</span>, the last name starts at position <span class="text-monospace">7</span>, which can be obtained by:   length of <span class="text-monospace">firstName</span> + blanks + middle initial + period = 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 7

Question: 334
10.  The selection sort algorithm sorts an array  <span class="text-monospace">arr</span> of integers in ascending order as follows. <ol class="list-decimal" style="list-style-type:decimal">  Loop from  <span class="text-monospace">j = 0</span> to  <span class="text-monospace">j = arr.length-2</span> inclusive.   In each pass, swap  <span class="text-monospace">arr[j]</span> with the largest element in  <span class="text-monospace">arr[j+1]</span> through  <span class="text-monospace">arr[a.length-1]</span>.  </ol> A student writes the following code for this algorithm:  <img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg173_01.png"/>  The code doesn't work as intended. Which change should be made to fix it?
A. Change Line 3 to be:<img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg173_02a.png"/>  B. Change Line 6 to be:<img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg173_02b.png"/>  C.

Change Line 10 to be:<img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg173_02d.png"/>  E. Change Line 8 to be:<img alt="" src="https://img.crackap.com/ap/computer-science-a/br23/pg173_02e.png"/>
Correct Answer:  C
Explanation:
Answer: C   For each pass through the loop, you want <span class="text-monospace"><span class="text-monospace">minIndex</span></span>, the index of the smallest element, to be initialized to the first element in the piece of array still to be sorted. The first element is determined by the current value of <span class="text-monospace"><span class="text-monospace">j</span></span>. Therefore, <span class="text-monospace"><span class="text-monospace">minIndex</span></span> must be initialized to <span class="text-monospace"><span class="text-monospace">j</span></span> for each pass through the outer loop. If <span class="text-monospace"><span class="text-monospace">minIndex</span></span> is always initialized to 0, which is the mistake the student made, the algorithm after the first pass through the outer loop will never find a smaller value than <span class="text-monospace">arr[0]</span> (which is the smallest value in the whole array). This means that the array will not get sorted. Choice A is wrong because you need <span class="text-monospace">arr.length-1</span> passes. If the loop goes from 0 to <span class="text-monospace">arr.length-1</span>, there will be one pass too many, and <span class="text-monospace">arr[<span class="text-monospace">k</span>]</span> will give an <span class="text-monospace">ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</span> when <span class="text-monospace">k</span> equals <span class="text-monospace">j + 1</span>. Choice B fails in a similar way. If k equals <span class="text-monospace">arr.length</span>, <span class="text-monospace">arr[<span class="text-monospace">k</span>]</span> will give an <span class="text-monospace">ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</span>. Choice D doesn't make sense. If <span class="text-monospace">arr[k]</span> is smaller than <span class="text-monospace">arr[<span class="text-monospace">minIndex</span>]</span>, then <span class="text-monospace"><span class="text-monospace">minIndex</span></span> must be set equal to <span class="text-monospace"><span class="text-monospace">k</span></span>. Choice E is wrong because you're searching for the smallest element. You therefore need to do a "less-than" test.
